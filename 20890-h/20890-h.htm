<p>In this volume an attempt is made for the first time to edit <i>Bussy
D'Ambois</i> and <i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i> in a manner suitable to
the requirements of modern scholarship. Of the relations of this edition
to its predecessors some details are given in the Notes on the Text of
the two plays. But in these few prefatory words I should like to call
attention to one or two points, and make some acknowledgments.</p>

<p>The immediate source of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> still remains undiscovered. But
the episodes in the career of Chapman's hero, vouched for by
contemporaries like Brant&ocirc;me and Marguerite of Valois, and related in
some detail in my <i>Introduction</i>, are typical of the material which the
dramatist worked upon. And an important clue to the spirit in which he
handled it is the identification, here first made, of part of Bussy's
dying speech with lines put by Seneca into the mouth of Hercules in his
last agony on Mount &OElig;ta. The exploits of D'Ambois were in Chapman's
imaginative vision those of a semi-mythical hero rather than of a
Frenchman whose life overlapped with his own.</p>

<p>On the <i>provenance</i> of <i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i> I have been
fortunately able, with valuable assistance from others, to cast much new
light. In an article in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>, Jan. 10, 1903, I showed that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>immediate source of many of the episodes in the play was Edward
Grimeston's translation (1607) of Jean de Serres's <i>Inventaire G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
de l'Histoire de France</i>. Since that date I owe to Mr. H. Richards,
Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, the important discovery that a number
of speeches in the play are borrowed from the <i>Discourses</i> of Epictetus,
from whom Chapman drew his conception of the character of Clermont
D'Ambois. My brother-in-law, Mr. S. G. Owen, Student of Christ Church,
has given me valuable help in explaining some obscure classical
allusions. Dr. J. A. H. Murray, the editor of the <i>New English
Dictionary</i>, has kindly furnished me with the interpretation of a
difficult passage in <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>; and Mr. W. J. Craig, editor of
the <i>Arden</i> Shakespeare, and Mr. Le Gay Brereton, of the University of
Sidney, have been good enough to proffer helpful suggestions. Finally I
am indebted to Professor George P. Baker, the General Editor of this
Series, for valuable advice and help on a large number of points, while
the proofs of this volume were passing through the press.</p>

<p>George Chapman was probably born in the year after Elizabeth's
accession. Anthony Wood gives 1557 as the date, but the inscription on
his portrait, prefixed to the edition of <i>The Whole Works of Homer</i> in
1616, points to 1559. He was a native of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, as we
learn from an allusion in his poem <i>Euthymi&aelig; Raptus</i> or <i>The Teares of
Peace</i>, and from W. Browne's reference to him in <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>
as "the learned shepheard of faire Hitching Hill." According to Wood "in
1574 or thereabouts, he being well grounded in school learning was sent
to the University." Wood is uncertain whether he went first to Oxford or
to Cambridge, but he is sure, though he gives no authority for the
statement, that Chapman spent some time at the former "where he was
observed to be most excellent in the Latin &amp; Greek tongues, but not in
logic or philosophy, and therefore I presume that that was the reason
why he took no degree there."</p>

<p>His life for almost a couple of decades afterwards is a blank, though it
has been conjectured on evidences drawn from <i>The Shadow of Night</i> and
<i>Alphonsus Emperor of Germany</i>, respectively, that he served in one of
Sir F. Vere's campaigns in the Netherlands, and that he travelled in
Germany. <i>The Shadow of Night</i>, consisting of two "poeticall hymnes"
appeared in 1594, and is his first extant work. It was followed in 1595
by <i>Ovid's Banquet of Sence</i>, <i>The Amorous Zodiac</i>, and other poems.
These early compositions, while containing fine passages, are obscure
and crabbed in style.<a name="FNanchor_V:1_1" id="FNanchor_V:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_V:1_1" class="fnanchor">[v:1]</a> In 1598 appeared Marlowe's fragmentary <i>Hero
and Leander</i> with Chapman's continuation. By this year he had
established his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>position as a playwright, for Meres in his <i>Palladis
Tamia</i> praises him both as a writer of tragedy and of comedy. We know
from Henslowe's <i>Diary</i> that his earliest extant comedy <i>The Blinde
Begger of Alexandria</i> was produced on February 12, 1596, and that for
the next two or three years he was working busily for this enterprising
manager. <i>An Humerous dayes Myrth</i> (pr. 1599), and <i>All Fooles</i> (pr.
1605) under the earlier title of <i>The World Runs on Wheels</i>,<a name="FNanchor_VI:1_2" id="FNanchor_VI:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_VI:1_2" class="fnanchor">[vi:1]</a> were
composed during this period.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had begun the work with which his name is most closely
linked, his translation of Homer. The first instalment, entitled <i>Seaven
Bookes of the Iliades of Homere, Prince of Poets</i>, was published in
1598, and was dedicated to the Earl of Essex. After the Earl's execution
Chapman found a yet more powerful patron, for, as we learn from the
letters printed recently in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> (cf. <i>Bibliography</i>, sec.
<span class="smcap">iii</span>), he was appointed about 1604 "sewer (i. e. cupbearer) in ordinary,"
to Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. The Prince encouraged him to
proceed with his translation, and about 1609 appeared the first twelve
books of the <i>Iliad</i> (including the seven formerly published) with a
fine "Epistle Dedicatory," to "the high-born Prince of men, Henry." In
1611 the version of the <i>Iliad</i> was completed, and that of the <i>Odyssey</i>
was, at Prince Henry's desire, now taken in hand. But the untimely death
of the Prince, on November 6th, 1612, dashed all Chapman's hopes of
receiving the anticipated reward of his labours. According to a petition
which he addressed to the Privy Council, the Prince had promised him on
the conclusion of his translation &pound;300, and "uppon his deathbed a good
pension during my life." Not only were both of these withheld, but he
was deprived of his post of "sewer" by Prince Charles. Nevertheless he
completed the version of the <i>Odyssey</i> in 1614, and in 1616 he published
a folio volume entitled <i>The Whole Works of Homer</i>. The translation, in
spite of its inaccuracies and its "conceits," is, by virtue of its
sustained dignity and vigour, one of the noblest monuments of
Elizabethan genius.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
By 1605, if not earlier, Chapman had resumed his work for the stage. In
that year he wrote conjointly with Marston and Jonson the comedy of
<i>Eastward Hoe</i>. On account of some passages reflecting on the Scotch,
the authors were imprisoned. The details of the affair are obscure.
According to Jonson, in his conversation later with Drummond, Chapman
and Marston were responsible for the obnoxious passages, and he
voluntarily imprisoned himself with them. But in one of the recently
printed letters, which apparently refers to this episode, Chapman
declares that he and Jonson lie under the Kings displeasure for "two
clawses and both of them not our owne," i. e., apparently, written by
Marston.<a name="FNanchor_VII:1_3" id="FNanchor_VII:1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII:1_3" class="fnanchor">[vii:1]</a> However this may be, the offenders were soon released,
and Chapman continued energetically his dramatic work. In 1606 appeared
two of his most elaborate comedies, <i>The Gentleman Usher</i> and <i>Monsieur
D'Olive</i>, and in the next year was published his first and most
successful tragedy, <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>. In 1608 were produced two
connected plays, <i>The Conspiracie and Tragedie of Charles, Duke of
Byron</i>, dealing with recent events in France, and based upon materials
in E. Grimeston's translation (1607) of Jean de Serres' History. Again
Chapman found himself in trouble with the authorities, for the French
ambassador, offended by a scene in which Henry IV's Queen was introduced
in unseemly fashion, had the performance of the plays stopped for a
time. Chapman had to go into hiding to avoid arrest, and when he came
out, he had great difficulty in getting the plays licensed for
publication, even with the omission of the offending episodes. His
fourth tragedy based on French history, <i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i>,
appeared in 1613. It had been preceded by two comedies, <i>May-Day</i>
(1611), and <i>The Widdowes' Teares</i> (1612). Possibly, as Mr Dobell
suggests (<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 23 March, 1901), the coarse satire of the latter
play may have been due to its author's annoyance at the apparent refusal
of his suit by a widow to whom some of the recently printed letters are
addressed. In 1613 he produced his <i>Maske of the Middle Temple and
Lyncolns Inne</i>, which was one of the series performed in honour of the
marriage of the Princess Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine. Another
hymeneal work, produced on a much less auspicious occasion, was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>allegorical poem, <i>Andromeda Liberata</i>, celebrating the marriage of the
Earl of Somerset with the divorced Lady Essex in December, 1613.</p>

<p>The year 1614, when the <i>Odyssey</i> was completed, marks the culminating
point of Chapman's literary activity. Henceforward, partly perhaps owing
to the disappointment of his hopes through Prince Henry's death, his
production was more intermittent. Translations of the <i>Homeric Hymns</i>,
of the <i>Georgicks</i> of Hesiod, and other classical writings, mainly
occupy the period till 1631. In that year he printed another tragedy,
<i>C&aelig;sar and Pompey</i>, which, however, as we learn from the dedication, had
been written "long since." The remaining plays with which his name has
been connected did not appear during his lifetime. A comedy, <i>The Ball</i>,
licensed in 1632, but not published till 1639, has the names of Chapman
and Shirley on the title-page, but the latter was certainly its main
author. Another play, however, issued in the same year, and ascribed to
the same hands, <i>The Tragedie of Chabot, Admiral of France</i> makes the
impression, from its subject-matter and its style, of being chiefly due
to Chapman. In 1654 two tragedies, <i>Alphonsus Emperour of Germany</i> and
<i>The Revenge for Honour</i>, were separately published under Chapman's
name. Their authorship, however, is doubtful. There is nothing in the
style or diction of <i>Alphonsus</i> which resembles Chapman's undisputed
work, and it is hard to believe that he had a hand in it. <i>The Revenge
for Honour</i> is on an Oriental theme, entirely different from those
handled by Chapman in his other tragedies, and the versification is
marked by a greater frequency of feminine endings than is usual with
him; but phrases and thoughts occur which may be paralleled from his
plays, and the work may be from his hand.</p>

<p>On May 12, 1634, he died, and was buried in the churchyard of St.
Giles's in the Field, where his friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to
his memory. According to Wood, he was a person of "most reverend aspect,
religious and temperate, qualities rarely meeting in a poet." Though his
material success seems to have been small, he gained the friendship of
many of the most illustrious spirits of his time&mdash;Essex, Prince Henry,
Bacon, Jonson, Webster, among the number&mdash;and it has been his good
fortune to draw in after years splendid tributes from such successors in
the poetic art as Keats and A. C. Swinburne.</p>

<p>The group of Chapman's plays based upon recent French history, to which
<i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> and its sequel belong, forms one of the most unique
memorials of the Elizabethan drama. The playwrights of the period were
profoundly interested in the annals of their own country, and exploited
them for the stage with a magnificent indifference to historical
accuracy. Gorboduc and Locrine were as real to them as any Lancastrian
or Tudor prince, and their reigns were made to furnish salutary lessons
to sixteenth century "magistrates." Scarcely less interesting were the
heroes of republican Greece and Rome: C&aelig;sar, Pompey, and Antony, decked
out in Elizabethan garb, were as familiar to the playgoers of the time
as their own national heroes, real or legendary. But the contemporary
history of continental states had comparatively little attraction for
the dramatists of the period, and when they handled it, they usually had
some political or religious end in view. Under a thin veil of allegory,
Lyly in <i>Midas</i> gratified his audience with a scathing denunciation of
the ambition and gold-hunger of Philip II of Spain; and half a century
later Middleton in a still bolder and more transparent allegory, <i>The
Game of Chess</i>, dared to ridicule on the stage Philip's successor, and
his envoy, Gondomar. But both plays were suggested by the elements of
friction in the relations of England and Spain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>French history also supplied material to some of the London
playwrights, but almost exclusively as it bore upon the great conflict
between the forces of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The <i>Masaker
of France</i>, which Henslowe mentions as having been played on January 3,
1592-3, may or may not be identical with Marlowe's <i>The Massacre at
Paris</i>, printed towards the close of the sixteenth century, but in all
probability it expressed similarly the burning indignation of Protestant
England at the appalling events of the Eve of St. Bartholomew. Whatever
Marlowe's religious or irreligious views may have been, he acted on this
occasion as the mouthpiece of the vast majority of his countrymen, and
he founded on recent French history a play which, with all its defects,
is of special interest to our present inquiry. For Chapman, who finished
Marlowe's incompleted poem, <i>Hero and Leander</i>, must have been familiar
with this drama, which introduced personages and events that were partly
to reappear in the two <i>Bussy</i> plays. A brief examination of <i>The
Massacre at Paris</i> will, therefore, help to throw into relief the
special characteristics of Chapman's dramas.</p>

<p>It opens with the marriage, in 1572, of Henry of Navarre and Margaret,
sister of King Charles IX, which was intended to assuage the religious
strife. But the Duke of Guise, the protagonist of the play, is
determined to counterwork this policy, and with the aid of Catherine de
Medicis, the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of Anjou (afterwards Henry III),
he arranges the massacre of the Huguenots. Of the events of the fatal
night we get a number of glimpses, including the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>murder of a
Protestant, Scroune, by Mountsorrell (Chapman's Montsurry), who is
represented as one of the Guise's most fanatical adherents. Charles soon
afterwards dies, and is succeeded by his brother Henry, but "his mind
runs on his minions," and Catherine and the Guise wield all real power.
But there is one sphere which Guise cannot control&mdash;his wife's heart,
which is given to Mugeroun, one of the "minions" of the King. Another of
the minions, Joyeux, is sent against Henry of Navarre, and is defeated
and slain; but Henry, learning that Guise has raised an army against his
sovereign "to plant the Pope and Popelings in the realm," joins forces
with the King against the rebel, who is treacherously murdered and dies
crying, "<i>Vive la messe!</i> perish Huguenots!" His brother, the Cardinal,
meets a similar fate, but the house of Lorraine is speedily revenged by
a friar, who stabs King Henry. He dies, vowing vengeance upon Rome, and
sending messages to Queen Elizabeth, "whom God hath bless'd for hating
papistry."</p>

<p>It is easy to see how a play on these lines would have appealed to an
Elizabethan audience, while Marlowe, whether his religious sympathies
were engaged or not, realized the dramatic possibilities of the figure
of the Guise, one of the lawlessly aspiring brotherhood that had so
irresistible a fascination for his genius. But it is much more difficult
to understand why, soon after the accession of James I, Chapman should
have gone back to the same period of French history, and reintroduced a
number of the same prominent figures, Henry III, Guise, his Duchess, and
Mountsorrell, not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>in their relation to great political and religious
outbreaks, but grouped round a figure who can scarcely have been very
familiar to the English theatre-going public&mdash;Louis de Clermont, Bussy
d'Amboise.<a name="FNanchor_XII:1_4" id="FNanchor_XII:1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_XII:1_4" class="fnanchor">[xii:1]</a></p>

<p>This personage was born in 1549, and was the eldest son of Jacques de
Clermont d'Amboise, seigneur de Bussy et de Saxe-Fontaine, by his first
wife, Catherine de Beauvais. He followed the career of arms, and in 1568
we hear of him as a commandant of a company. He was in Paris during the
massacre of St. Bartholomew, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>and took advantage of it to settle a
private feud. He had had a prolonged lawsuit with his cousin Antoine de
Clermont, a prominent Huguenot, and follower of the King of Navarre.
While his rival was fleeing for safety he had the misfortune to fall
into the hands of Bussy, who dispatched him then and there. He
afterwards distinguished himself in various operations against the
Huguenots, and by his bravery and accomplishments won the favour of the
Duke of Anjou, who, after the accession of Henry III in 1575, was heir
to the throne. The Duke in this year appointed him his <i>couronell</i>, and
henceforward he passed into his service. In 1576, as a reward for
negotiating "<i>la paix de Monsieur</i>" with the Huguenots, the Duke
received the territories of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry, and at once
appointed Bussy governor of Anjou. In November the new governor arrived
at Angers, the capital of the Duchy, and was welcomed by the citizens;
but the disorders and exactions of his troops soon aroused the anger of
the populace, and the King had to interfere in their behalf, though for
a time Bussy set his injunctions at defiance. At last he retired from
the city, and rejoined the Duke, in close intercourse with whom he
remained during the following years, accompanying him finally on his
unsuccessful expedition to the Low Countries in the summer of 1578. On
Anjou's return to court in January, 1579, Bussy, who seems to have
alienated his patron by his presumptuous behaviour, did not go with him,
but took up his residence again in the territory of Anjou. He was less
occupied, however, with his official duties than with his criminal
passion <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>for Fran&ccedil;oise de Maridort, wife of the Comte de Monsoreau, who
had been appointed <i>grand-veneur</i> to the Duke. The favorite mansion of
the Comte was at La Coutanci&egrave;re, and it was here that Bussy ardently
pursued his intrigue with the Countess. But a jocular letter on the
subject, which he sent to the Duke of Anjou, was shown, according to the
historian, De Thou, by the Duke to the King, who, in his turn, passed it
on to Montsoreau. The latter thereupon forced his wife to make a
treacherous assignation with Bussy at the ch&acirc;teau on the night of the
18th of August, and on his appearance, with his companion in pleasure,
Claude Colasseau, they were both assassinated by the retainers of the
infuriated husband.</p>

<p>The tragic close of Bussy's life has given his career an interest
disproportionate to his historical importance. But the drama of La
Coutanci&egrave;re was only the final episode in a career crowded with romantic
incidents. The annalists and memoir-writers of the period prove that
Bussy's exploits as a duellist and a gallant had impressed vividly the
imagination of his contemporaries. Margaret of Valois, the wife of Henry
IV, Brant&ocirc;me, who was a relative and friend of D'Ambois, and L'Estoile,
the chronicler and journalist, are amongst those who have left us their
impressions of this <i>beau sabreur</i>. Chapman must have had access to
memorials akin to theirs as a foundation for his drama, and though, for
chronological reasons, they cannot have been utilized by him, they
illustrate the materials which he employed.</p>

<p>The first two Acts of the play are chiefly occupied <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>with Bussy's
arrival at court, his entry into the service of Monsieur, his quarrel
with Guise, and the duel between himself and Barrisor, with two
supporters on either side. Brant&ocirc;me, in his <i>Discours sur les Duels</i>,
relates from personal knowledge an incident between Guise and Bussy,
which took place shortly after the accession of Henry III. The Duke took
occasion of a royal hunting party to draw Bussy alone into the forest,
and to demand certain explanations of him. D'Ambois gave these in a
satisfactory manner; but had he not done so, the Duke declared, in spite
of their difference of rank, he would have engaged in single combat with
him. The explanations demanded may well have concerned the honour of the
Duchess, and we get at any rate a hint for the episode in Chapman's play
(<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_I_ii_55"><span class="smcap">i</span>, ii, 57-185</a>).</p>

<p>For the duelling narrative (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_i_35"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i, 35-137</a>) we get considerably more than
a hint. Our chief authority is again Brant&ocirc;me, in another work, the
<i>Discours sur les Couronnels de l'infanterie de France</i>. He tells us
that he was with Bussy at a play, when a dispute arose between him and
the Marquis of Saint-Phal as to whether the jet embroidery on a certain
muff represented <span class="smcap">xx</span> or <span class="smcap">yy</span>. The quarrel was appeased for the time being,
but on the following day Bussy, meeting Saint-Phal at the house of a
lady with whom he had had relations, and who was now the mistress of the
Marquis, renewed the dispute. An encounter took place between Bussy,
supported by five or six gentlemen, and Saint-Phal, assisted by an equal
number of Scotchmen of the Royal Guard, one of whom wounded Bussy's
hand. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>Thereupon Saint-Phal withdrew, but his fire-eating rival was
anxious at all hazards for another encounter. It was only with the
greatest difficulty, as Brant&ocirc;me relates in entertaining fashion, that
the King was able to bring about a reconciliation between them. Such an
episode, reported with exaggeration of details, might well have
suggested the narrative in Act <span class="smcap">ii</span> of the triple encounter.</p>

<p>Brant&ocirc;me further relates a midnight attack upon Bussy, about a month
later, by a number of his jealous rivals, when he had a narrow escape
from death. Of this incident another account has been given by Margaret
of Valois in her <i>M&eacute;moires</i>. Margaret and her brother, the Duke of
Anjou, were devoted to one another, and Bussy was for a time a paramour
of the Queen of Navarre. Though she denies the liaison, she says of him
that there was not "<i>en ce si&egrave;cle-l&agrave; de son sexe et de sa qualit&eacute; rien
de semblable en valeur, reputation, grace, et esprit</i>." Margaret,
L'Estoile, and Brant&ocirc;me all relate similar incidents during Bussy's
sojourn at court in the year 1578, and the last-named adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Si je voulois raconter toutes les querelles qu'il a eues,
j'aurois beaucoup affaire; h&eacute;las! il en a trop eu, et toutes
les a desmesl&eacute;es &agrave; son tr&egrave;s-grand honneur et heur. Il en
vouloit souvant par trop &agrave; plusieurs, sans aucun respect; je
luy ay dict cent fois; mais il se fioit tant en sa valeur qu'il
mesprisoit tous les conseils de ses amis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dieu ayt son &acirc;me!
Mais il mourut (quand il trespassa) un preux tr&eacute;s vaillant et
g&eacute;n&eacute;reux.</i>"</p></div>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that Chapman in his picture of Bussy's quarrels
and encounters-at-arms was deviating little, except in details of names
and dates, from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>the actual facts of history. Bussy's career was so
romantic that it was impossible for even the most inventive dramatist to
embellish it. This was especially true of its closing episode, which
occupies the later acts of Chapman's drama&mdash;the intrigue with the
Countess of Montsoreau and the tragic fate which it involved. It is
somewhat singular that the earliest narratives of the event which have
come down to us were published subsequently to the play. The statement,
accepted for a long time, that De Thou's <i>Histori&aelig; sui Temporis</i> was the
basis of Chapman's tragedy, has been completely disproved. The passage
in which he narrates the story of Bussy's death does not occur in the
earlier editions of his work, and first found its way into the issue
published at Geneva in 1620. A similar narrative appeared in the
following year in L'Estoile's <i>Journal</i>, which first saw the light in
1621, ten years after its author's death. But under a thin disguise
there had already appeared a detailed history of Bussy's last <i>amour</i>
and his fall, though this, too, was later than Chapman's drama. A
novelist, Fran&ccedil;ois de Rosset, had published a volume of tales entitled
<i>Les Histoires Tragiques de Nostre Temps</i>. The earliest known edition is
one of 1615, though it was preceded, probably not long, by an earlier
edition full of "<i>fautes insupportables</i>," for which Rosset apologizes.
He is careful to state in his preface that he is relating "<i>des
histoires autant veritables que tristes et funestes. Les noms de la
pluspart des personnages sont seulement desguisez en ce Theatre, &agrave; fin
de n'affliger pas tant les familles de ceux qui en ont donn&eacute; le sujet.</i>"
The fate of Bussy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>forms the subject of the seventeenth history,
entitled "<i>De la mort pitoyable du valeureux Lysis</i>." Lysis was the name
under which Margaret of Valois celebrated the memory of her former lover
in a poem entitled "<i>L'esprit de Lysis disant adieu &agrave; sa Flore</i>." But
apart from this proof of identification, the details given by Rosset are
so full that there can be no uncertainty in the matter. Indeed, in some
of his statements, as in his account of the first meeting between the
lovers, Rosset probably supplies facts unrecorded by the historians of
the period.</p>

<p>From a comparison of these more or less contemporary records it is
evident that, whatever actual source Chapman may have used, he has given
in many respects a faithful portrait of the historical Bussy D'Ambois.
It happened that at the time of Bussy's death the Duke of Anjou, his
patron, was in London, laying ineffective siege to the hand of
Elizabeth. This coincidence may have given wider currency in England to
Bussy's tragic story than would otherwise have been the case. But a
quarter of a century later this adventitious interest would have
evaporated, and the success of Chapman's play would be due less to its
theme than to its qualities of style and construction. To these we must
therefore now turn.</p>

<p>With Chapman's enthusiasm for classical literature, it was natural that
he should be influenced by classical models, even when handling a
thoroughly modern subject. His Bussy is, in certain aspects, the <i>miles
gloriosus</i> of Latin drama, while in the tragic crisis of his fate he
demonstrably borrows, as is shown in this edition <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>for the first time,
the accents of the Senecan Hercules on Mount &OElig;ta (cf. <a href="#note_on_V_iv">notes on <span class="smcap">v</span>, iv,
100 and 109</a>). Hence the technique of the work is largely of the
semi-Senecan type with which Kyd and his school had familiarized the
English stage. Thus Bussy's opening monologue serves in some sort as a
Prologue; the narrative by the <i>Nuntius</i> in <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_i_35">Act <span class="smcap">ii</span>, i, 35-137</a>, is in the
most approved classical manner; an <i>Umbra</i> or Ghost makes its regulation
entrance in the last Act, and though the accumulated horrors of the
closing scenes violate every canon of classical art, they had become
traditional in the semi-Senecan type of play, and were doubtless highly
acceptable to the audiences of the period. But while the Senecan and
semi-Senecan methods had their dangers, their effect on English
dramatists was in so far salutary that they necessitated care in
plot-construction. And it is doubtful whether Chapman has hitherto
received due credit for the ingenuity and skill with which he has woven
into the texture of his drama a number of varied threads. Bussy's life
was, as has been shown, crowded with incidents, and the final
catastrophe at La Coutanci&egrave;re had no direct relation with the duels and
intrigues of his younger days at Court. Chapman, however, has connected
the earlier and the later episodes with much ingenuity. Departing from
historical truth, he represents Bussy as a poor adventurer at Court,
whose fortunes are entirely made by the patronage of Monsieur. His
sudden elevation turns his head, and he insults the Duke of Guise by
courting his wife before his face, thus earning his enmity, and exciting
at the same time <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>the ridicule of the other courtiers. Hence springs the
encounter with Barrisor and his companions, and this is made to serve as
an introduction to the <i>amour</i> between Bussy and Tamyra, as Chapman
chooses to call the Countess of Montsurry. For Barrisor, we are told
(<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_ii_200"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, ii, 202 ff.</a>), had long wooed the Countess, and the report was
spread that the "main quarrel" between him and Bussy "grew about her
love," Barrisor thinking that D'Ambois's courtship of the Duchess of
Guise was really directed towards "his elected mistress." On the advice
of a Friar named Comolet, to whom Chapman strangely enough assigns the
repulsive <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of go-between, Bussy wins his way at night into
Tamyra's chamber on the plea that he has come to reassure her that she
is in no way guilty of Barrisor's blood. Thus the main theme of the play
is linked with the opening incidents, and the action from first to last
is laid in Paris, whither the closing scenes of Bussy's career are
shifted. By another ingenious departure from historical truth the Duke
of Anjou, to whom Bussy owes his rise, is represented as the main agent
in his fall. He is angered at the favour shown by the King to the
follower whom he had raised to serve his own ends, and he conspires with
Guise for his overthrow. He is the more eagerly bent upon this when he
discovers through Tamyra's waiting-woman that the Countess, whose
favours he has vainly sought to win, has granted them to Bussy. It is he
who, by means of a paper, convinces Montsurry of his wife's guilt, and
it is he, together with Guise, who suggests to the Count the stratagem
by which Tamyra is forced to decoy her <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>paramour to his doom. All this
is deftly contrived and does credit to Chapman's dramatic craftsmanship.
It is true that the last two Acts are spun out with supernatural
episodes of a singularly unconvincing type. The Friar's invocation of
Behemoth, who proves a most unserviceable spirit, and the vain attempts
of this scoundrelly ecclesiastic's ghost to shield D'Ambois from his
fate, strike us as wofully crude and mechanical excursions into the
occult. But they doubtless served their turn with audiences who had an
insatiable craving for such manifestations, and were not particular as
to the precise form they took.</p>

<p>In point of character-drawing the play presents a more complex problem.
Bussy is a typically Renaissance hero and appealed to the sympathies of
an age which set store above all things on exuberant vitality and
prowess, and was readier than our own to allow them full rein. The King
seems to be giving voice to Chapman's conception of Bussy's character,
when he describes him in <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_III_ii_90"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, ii, 90 ff.</a> as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man so good that only would uphold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man in his native noblesse, from whose fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All our dissentions arise," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in certain aspects Bussy does not come far short of the ideal thus
pictured. His bravery, versatility, frankness, and readiness of speech
are all vividly portrayed, while his mettlesome temper and his arrogance
are alike essential to his <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, and are true to the record of the
historical D'Ambois. But there is a coarseness of fibre in Chapman's
creation, an occasional <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>foul-mouthed ribaldry of utterance which robs
him of sympathetic charm. He has in him more of the swashbuckler and the
bully than of the courtier and the cavalier. Beaumont and Fletcher, one
cannot help feeling, would have invested him with more refinement and
grace, and would have given a tenderer note to the love-scenes between
him and Tamyra. Bussy takes the Countess's affections so completely by
storm, and he ignores so entirely the rights of her husband, that it is
difficult to accord him the measure of sympathy in his fall, which the
fate of a tragic hero should evoke.</p>

<p>Tamyra appeals more to us, because we see in her more of the conflict
between passion and moral obligation, which is the essence of drama. Her
scornful rejection of the advances of Monsieur (<a href="#Bussy_II_ii"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, ii</a>), though her
husband palliates his conduct as that of "a bachelor and a courtier, I,
and a prince," proves that she is no light o' love, and that her
surrender to Bussy is the result of a sudden and overmastering passion.
Even in the moment of keenest expectation she is torn between
conflicting emotions (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_ii_165"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, ii, 169-182</a>), and after their first interview,
Bussy takes her to task because her</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Conscience is too nice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bites too hotly of the Puritane spice."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But she masters her scruples sufficiently to play the thorough-going
dissembler when she meets her husband, and she keeps up the pretence
when she declares to Bussy before the Court (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_III_ii_135"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, ii, 138</a>), "Y'are one I
know not," and speaks of him vaguely in a later scene as "the man." So,
too, when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>Montsurry first tells her of the suspicions which Monsieur
has excited in him, she protests with artfully calculated indignation
against the charge of wrong-doing with this "serpent." But the brutal
and deliberate violence of her husband when he knows the truth, and the
perfidious meanness with which he makes her the reluctant instrument of
her lover's ruin, win back for her much of our alienated sympathy. Yet
at the close her position is curiously equivocal. It is at her prayer
that Bussy has spared Montsurry when "he hath him down" in the final
struggle; but when her lover is mortally wounded by a pistol shot, she
implores his pardon for her share in bringing him to his doom. And when
the Friar's ghost seeks to reconcile husband and wife, the former is
justified in crying ironically (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_V_iv_160"><span class="smcap">v</span>, iv, 163-64</a>):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See how she merits this, still kneeling by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourning his fall, more than her own fault!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Montsurry's portraiture, indeed, suffers from the same lack of
consistency as his wife's. In his earlier relations with her he strikes
a tenderer note than is heard elsewhere in the play, and his first
outburst of fury, when his suspicions are aroused, springs, like
Othello's, from the depth of his love and trust (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_IV_i_165"><span class="smcap">iv</span>, i, 169-70</a>):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"My whole heart is wounded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When any least thought in you is but touch'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there is nothing of Othello's noble agony of soul, nor of his sense
that he is carrying out a solemn judicial act on the woman he still
loves, in Montsurry's long-drawn torture of his wife. Indeed a
comparison <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>of the episodes brings into relief the restraint and purity
of Shakespeare's art when handling the most terrible of tragic themes.
Yet the Moor himself might have uttered Montsurry's cry (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_V_i_180"><span class="smcap">v</span>, i, 183-85</a>),</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Here, here was she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was a whole world without spot to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now a world of spot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there is something of pathetic dignity in his final forgiveness of
his wife, coupled with the declaration that his honour demands that she
must fly his house for ever.</p>

<p>Monsieur and the Guise are simpler types. The former is the ambitious
villain of quality, chafing at the thought that there is but a thread
betwixt him and a crown, and prepared to compass his ends by any means
that fall short of the actual killing of the King. It is as a useful
adherent of his faction that he elevates Bussy, and when he finds him
favoured by Henry he ruthlessly strikes him down, all the more readily
that he is his successful rival for Tamyra's love. He is the typical
Renaissance politician, whose characteristics are expounded with
characteristically vituperative energy by Bussy in <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_III_ii_435"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, ii, 439-94</a>.</p>

<p>Beside this arch-villain, the Guise, aspiring and factious though he be,
falls into a secondary place. Probably Chapman did not care to elaborate
a figure of whom Marlowe had given so powerful a sketch in the <i>Massacre
at Paris</i>. The influence of the early play may also be seen in the
handling of the King, who is portrayed with an indulgent pen, and who
reappears <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of an enthusiastic admirer of the English Queen
and Court. The other personages in the drama are colourless, though
Chapman succeeds in creating the general atmosphere of a frivolous and
dissolute society.</p>

<p>But the plot and portraiture in <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> are both less
distinctive than the "full and heightened" style, to which was largely
due its popularity with readers and theatre-goers of its period, but
which was afterwards to bring upon it such severe censure, when taste
had changed. Dryden's onslaught in his <i>Dedication to the Spanish Friar</i>
(1681) marks the full turn of the tide. The passage is familiar, but it
must be reproduced here:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have sometimes wondered, in the reading, what has become of
those glaring colours which annoyed me in <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> upon
the theatre; but when I had taken up what I supposed a fallen
star, I found I had been cozened with a jelly; nothing but a
cold dull mass, which glittered no longer than it was shooting;
a dwarfish thought, dressed up in gigantic words, repetition in
abundance, looseness of expression, and gross hyperboles; the
sense of one line expanded prodigiously into ten; and, to sum
up all, uncorrect English, and a hideous mingle of false poetry
and true nonsense; or, at best, a scantling of wit, which lay
gasping for life, and groaning beneath a heap of rubbish. A
famous modern poet used to sacrifice every year a Statius to
Virgil's <i>manes</i>; and I have indignation enough to burn a
<i>D'Ambois</i> annually to the memory of Jonson."</p></div>

<p>Dryden's critical verdicts are never lightly to be set aside. He is
singularly shrewd and unprejudiced in his judgements, and has a
remarkable faculty of hitting the right nail on the head. But Chapman,
in whom the barbarian and the pedant were so strongly commingled, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>was a
type that fell outside the wide range of Dryden's appreciation. The
Restoration writer fails, in the first place, to recognize that <i>Bussy
D'Ambois</i> is pitched advisedly from first to last in a high key.
Throughout the drama men and women are playing for great stakes. No one
is ever at rest. Action and passion are both at fever heat. We move in
an atmosphere of duels and state intrigues by day, of assignations and
murders by night. Even the subordinate personages in the drama, the
stewards and waiting-women, partake of the restless spirit of their
superiors. They are constantly arguing, quarrelling, gossiping&mdash;their
tongues and wits are always on the move. Thus Chapman aimed throughout
at energy of expression at all costs. To this he sacrificed beauty of
phrase and rhythm, even lucidity. He pushed it often to exaggerated
extremes of coarseness and riotous fancy. He laid on "glaring colours"
till eye and brain are fatigued. To this opening phrase of Dryden no
exception can be taken. But can his further charges stand? Is it true to
say of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> that it is characterised by "dwarfish thought
dressed up in gigantic words," that it is "a hideous mingle of false
poetry and true nonsense"? The accusation of "nonsense" recoils upon its
maker. Involved, obscure, inflated as Chapman's phrasing not
infrequently is, it is not mere rhodomontade, sound, and fury,
signifying nothing. There are some passages (as the Notes testify) where
the thread of his meaning seems to disappear amidst his fertile imagery,
but even here one feels not that sense is lacking, but that one has
failed to find the clue to the zigzag movements of Chapman's brain. Nor
is it fair <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>to speak of Chapman as dressing up dwarfish thoughts in
stilted phrases. There is not the slightest tendency in the play to spin
out words to hide a poverty of ideas; in fact many of the difficulties
spring from excessive condensation. Where Chapman is really assailable
is in a singular incontinence of imagery. Every idea that occurs to him
brings with it a plethora of illustrations, in the way of simile,
metaphor, or other figure of speech; he seems impotent to check the
exuberant riot of his fancy till it has exhausted its whole store. The
underlying thought in many passages, though not deserving Dryden's
contemptuous epithet, is sufficiently obvious. Chapman was not dowered
with the penetrating imagination that reveals as by a lightning flash
unsuspected depths of human character or of moral law. But he has the
gnomic faculty that can convey truths of general experience in
aphoristic form, and he can wind into a debatable moral issue with
adroit casuistry. Take for instance the discussion (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_i_145"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i, 149-79</a>) on
the legitimacy of private vengeance, or (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_III_i_10"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, i, 10-30</a>) on the nature
and effect of sin, or (<a href="#Bussy_V_ii"><span class="smcap">v</span>, ii</a>) on Nature's "blindness" in her workings.
In lighter vein, but winged with the shafts of a caustic humour are
Bussy's invectives against courtly practices (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_I_i_80"><span class="smcap">i</span>, i, 84-104</a>) and
hypocrisy in high places (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_III_ii_25"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, ii, 25-59</a>), while the "flyting" between
him and Monsieur is perhaps the choicest specimen of Elizabethan
"Billingsgate" that has come down to us. It was a versatile pen that
could turn from passages like these to the epic narrative of the duel,
or Tamyra's lyric invocation of the "peaceful regents of the night" (<a href="#lnumber_Bussy_II_ii_155"><span class="smcap">ii</span>,
ii, 158</a>), or Bussy's stately elegy upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>himself, as he dies standing,
propped on his true sword.</p>

<p>It can only have been the ingrained prejudice of the Restoration period
against "metaphysical" verse that deadened Dryden's ear to the charm of
such passages as these. Another less notable poet and playwright of the
time showed more discrimination. This was Thomas D'Urfey, who in 1691
brought out a revised version of the play at the Theatre Royal. In a
dedication to Lord Carlisle which he prefixed to this version, on its
publication in the same year, he testifies to the great popularity of
the play after the reopening of the theatres.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"About sixteen years since, when first my good or ill stars
ordained me a Knight Errant in this fairy land of poetry, I saw
the <i>Bussy d'Ambois</i> of Mr. Chapman acted by Mr. Hart, which in
spight of the obsolete phrases and intolerable fustian with
which a great part of it was cramm'd, and which I have altered
in these new sheets, had some extraordinary beauties, which
sensibly charmed me; which being improved by the graceful
action of that eternally renowned and best of actors, so
attracted not only me, but the town in general, that they were
obliged to pass by and excuse the gross errors in the writing,
and allow it amongst the rank of the topping tragedies of that
time."</p></div>

<p>Charles Hart, who was thus one of the long succession of actors to make
a striking reputation in the title part, died in 1683, and, according to
D'Urfey, "for a long time after" the play "lay buried in [his] grave."
But "not willing to have it quite lost, I presumed to revise it and
write the plot new." D'Urfey's main alteration was to represent Bussy
and Tamyra as having been betrothed before the play opens, and the
latter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>forced against her will into a marriage with the wealthy Count
Montsurry. This, he maintained, palliated the heroine's surrender to
passion and made her "distress in the last Act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. much more liable to
pity." Whether morality is really a gainer by this well-meant variation
from the more primitive code of the original play is open to question,
but we welcome the substitution of Teresia the "governess" and
confidante of Tamyra for Friar Comolet as the envoy between the lovers.
Another notable change is the omission of the narrative of the
<i>Nuntius</i>, which is replaced by a short duelling scene upon the stage.
D'Urfey rejects, too, the supernatural machinery in Act <span class="smcap">iv</span>, and the
details of the torture of the erring Countess, whom, at the close of the
play, he represents not as wandering from her husband's home, but as
stabbing herself in despair.</p>

<p>If Chapman's plot needed to be "writ new" at all, D'Urfey deserves
credit for having done his work with considerable skill and taste,
though he hints in his dedication that there were detractors who did not
view his version as favourably as Lord Carlisle. He had some difficulty,
he tells us, in finding an actor to undertake the part, but at last
prevailed upon Mountfort to do so, though he was diffident of appearing
in a <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in which Hart had made so great a reputation. Mrs.
Bracegirdle, as we learn from the list of <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> prefixed to
the published edition, played Tamyra, and the revival seems to have been
a success. But Mountfort was assassinated in the Strand towards the
close of the following year, and apparently the career of <i>Bussy</i> upon
the boards ended with his life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>In the same year as D'Urfey revised the play, Langbaine published his
<i>Account of the English Dramatick Poets</i>, wherein (p. 59) he mentions
that Bussy "has the preference" among all Chapman's writings and
vindicates it against Dryden's attack:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I know not how Mr. Dryden came to be so possest with
indignation against this play, as to resolve to burn one
annually to the memory of Ben Jonson: but I know very well that
there are some who allow it a just commendation; and others
that since have taken the liberty to promise a solemn annual
sacrifice of <i>The Hind and Panther</i> to the memory of Mr.
Quarles and John Bunyan."</p></div>

<p>But neither D'Urfey nor Langbaine could secure for <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> a
renewal of its earlier popularity. During the eighteenth century it fell
into complete oblivion, and though (as the Bibliography testifies)
nineteenth-century critics and commentators have sought to atone for the
neglect of their predecessors, the faults of the play, obvious at a
glance, have hitherto impaired the full recognition of its distinctive
merits of design and thought. To bring these into clearer relief, and
trace the relation of its plot to the recorded episodes of Bussy's
career, has been the aim of the preceding pages. It must always count to
Chapman's credit that he, an Englishman, realized to the full the
fascination of the brilliant Renaissance figure, who had to wait till
the nineteenth century to be rediscovered for literary purposes by the
greatest romance-writer among his own countrymen. In Bussy, the man of
action, there was a Titanic strain that appealed to Chapman's
intractable and rough-hewn genius. To the dramatist he was the classical
Hercules born anew, accomplishing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>similar feats, and lured to a similar
treacherous doom. Thus the cardinal virtue of the play is a Herculean
energy of movement and of speech which borrows something of epic quality
from the Homeric translations on which Chapman was simultaneously
engaged, and thereby links <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> to his most triumphant
literary achievement.</p>

<p>Six years after the publication of the first Quarto of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>
Chapman issued a sequel, <i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i>, which, as we
learn from the title-page, had been "often presented at the private
Playhouse in the White-Fryers." But in the interval he had written two
other plays based on recent French history, <i>Byrons Conspiracie</i> and
<i>The Tragedie of Charles Duke of Byron</i>, and in certain aspects <i>The
Revenge</i> is more closely related to these immediate forerunners than to
the piece of which it is the titular successor. The discovery which I
recently was fortunate enough to make of a common immediate source of
the two Byron plays and of <i>The Revenge</i> accentuates the connection
between them, and at the same time throws fresh light on the problem of
the <i>provenance</i> of the second D'Ambois drama.</p>

<p>In his scholarly monograph <i>Quellen Studien zu den Dramen George
Chapmans, Massingers, und Fords</i> (1897), E. Koeppel showed that the
three connected plays were based upon materials taken from Jean de
Serres's <i>Inventaire G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Histoire de France</i> (1603), Pierre
Matthieu's <i>Histoire de France durant Sept Ann&eacute;es de Paix du Regne de
Henri IV</i> (1605), and P. V. Cayet's <i>Chronologie Sept&eacute;naire de</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span><i>l'Histoire de la Paix entre les Roys de France et d'Espagne</i> (1605).
The picture suggested by Koeppel's treatise was of Chapman collating a
number of contemporary French historical works, and choosing from each
of them such portions as suited his dramatic purposes. But this
conception, as I have shown in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for Jan. 10, 1903, p. 51,
must now be abandoned. Chapman did not go to the French originals at
all, but to a more easily accessible source, wherein the task of
selection and rearrangement had already been in large measure performed.
In 1607 the printer, George Eld, published a handsome folio, of which
the British Museum possesses a fine copy (c. 66, b. 14), originally the
property of Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. Its title is: "<i>A
General Inventorie of the Historie of France, from the beginning of that
Monarchie, unto the Treatie of Vervins, in the Yeare 1598. Written by
Jhon de Serres. And continued unto these Times, out of the best Authors
which have written of that Subiect. Translated out of French into
English by Edward Grimeston, Gentleman.</i>" This work, the popularity of
which is attested by the publication of a second, enlarged, edition in
1611, was the direct source of the "Byron" plays, and of <i>The Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>In a dedication addressed to the Earls of Suffolk and Salisbury,
Grimeston states that having retired to "private and domesticke cares"
after "some years expence in France, for the publike service of the
State," he has translated "this generall Historie of France written by
John de Serres." In a preface "to the Reader" he makes the further
important statement:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The History of John de Serres ends with the Treatie at
Vervins betwixt France and Spaine in the yeare 1598. I have
been importuned to make the History perfect, and to continue it
unto these times, whereunto I have added (for your better
satisfaction) what I could extract out of Peter Mathew and
other late writers touching this subject. Some perchance will
challenge me of indiscretion, that I have not translated Peter
Mathew onely, being reputed so eloquent and learned a Writer.
To them I answere first, that I found many things written by
him that were not fit to be inserted, and some things belonging
unto the Historie, related by others, whereof he makes no
mention. Secondly his style is so full and his discourse so
copious, as the worke would have held no proportion, for that
this last addition of seven years must have exceeded halfe
Serres Historie. Which considerations have made me to draw
forth what I thought most materiall for the subject, and to
leave the rest as unnecessarie."</p></div>

<p>From this we learn that Grimeston followed Jean de Serres till 1598, and
that from then till 1604 (his time-limit in his first edition) his
principal source was P. Matthieu's <i>Histoire de France</i>, rigorously
condensed, and, at the same time, supplemented from other authorities. A
collation of Grimeston's text with that of the "Byron" plays and <i>The
Revenge</i> proves that every passage in which the dramatist draws upon
historical materials is to be found within the four corners of the folio
of 1607. The most striking illustrations of this are to be found in the
"Byron" plays, and I have shown elsewhere (<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) that
though Chapman in handling the career of the ill-fated Marshal of France
is apparently exploiting Pierre Matthieu, Jean de Serres, and Cayet in
turn, he is really taking advantage of the labours of Grimeston, who had
rifled their stores for his skilful historical mosaic. Grimeston must
thus henceforward be recognized as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>holding something of the same
relation to Chapman as Sir T. North does to Shakespeare, with the
distinction that he not only provides the raw material of historical
tragedy, but goes some way in the refining process.</p>

<p><i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i> follows historical lines less closely
than the "Byron" plays, but here, too, Grimeston's volume was Chapman's
inspiring source, and the perusal of its closing pages gives a clue to
the origin of this most singular of the dramatist's serious plays. The
final episode included in the folio of 1607 was the plot by which the
Count d'Auvergne, who had been one of Byron's fellow conspirators, and
who had fallen under suspicion for a second time in 1604, was
treacherously arrested by agents of the King while attending a review of
troops. The position of this narrative (translated from P. Matthieu) at
the close of the folio must have helped to draw Chapman's special
attention to it, and having expended his genius so liberally on the
career of the arch-conspirator of the period, he was apparently moved to
handle also that of his interesting confederate. But D'Auvergne's
fortunes scarcely furnished the stuff for a complete drama, on Chapman's
customary broad scale, and he seems therefore to have conceived the
ingenious idea of utilising them as the groundwork of a sequel to his
most popular play, <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>.</p>

<p>He transformed the Count into an imaginary brother of his former hero.
For though D'Ambois had two younger brothers, Hubert, seigneur de
Moigneville, and Georges, baron de Bussy, it is highly improbable that
Chapman had ever heard of them, and there was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>nothing in the career of
either to suggest the figure of Clermont D'Ambois. The name given by
Chapman to this unhistorical addition to the family was, I believe, due
to a mere chance, if not a misunderstanding. In Grimeston's narrative of
the plot against D'Auvergne he mentions that one of the King's agents,
D'Eurre, "came to Clermont on Monday at night, and goes unto him
[D'Auvergne] where he supped." Here the name Clermont denotes, of
course, a place. But Chapman may have possibly misconceived it to refer
to the Count, and, in any case, its occurrence in this context probably
suggested its bestowal upon the hero of the second D'Ambois play.</p>

<p>A later passage in Grimeston's history gives an interesting glimpse of
D'Auvergne's character. We are told that after he had been arrested, and
was being conducted to Paris, "all the way he seemed no more afflicted,
then when he was at libertie. He tould youthfull and idle tales of his
love, and the deceiving of ladies. Hee shott in a harquebuse at birds,
wherein hee was so perfect and excellent, as hee did kill larkes as they
were flying."</p>

<p>From this hint of a personality serenely proof against the shocks of
adversity Chapman elaborated the figure of the "Senecall man," Clermont
D'Ambois. In developing his conception he drew, however, not primarily,
as this phrase suggests, from the writings of the Roman senator and
sage, but from those of the lowlier, though not less authoritative
exponent of Stoic doctrine, the enfranchised slave, Epictetus. As is
shown, for the first time, in the Notes to this edition, the
<i>Discourses</i> of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>"the grave Greek moralist," known probably through a
Latin version (cf. <a href="#sidenote_Epict"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i, 157</a>), must have been almost as close to
Chapman's hand while he was writing <i>The Revenge</i> as Grimeston's
compilation. Five long passages in the play (<a href="#lnumber_Revenge_I_i_335"><span class="smcap">i</span>, i, 336-42</a>, <a href="#lnumber_Revenge_II_i_155"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i,
157-60</a>, <a href="#lnumber_Revenge_II_i_210"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i, 211-32</a>, <a href="#lnumber_Revenge_III_iv_55"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, iv, 58-75</a>, and <a href="#lnumber_Revenge_III_iv_125"><span class="smcap">iii</span>, iv, 127-41</a>) are
translated or adapted from specific <i>dicta</i> in the <i>Discourses</i>, while
Epictetus's work in its whole ethical teaching furnished material for
the delineation of the ideal Stoic (<a href="#lnumber_Revenge_IV_iv_10"><span class="smcap">iv</span>, iv, 14-46</a>) who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"May with heavens immortall powers compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the day and fortune equall are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come faire or foule, what ever chance can fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixt in himselfe, hee still is one to all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in the character of Clermont there mingle other elements than those
derived from either the historical figure of D'Auvergne, or the ideal
man of Stoic speculation. Had Hamlet never faltered in the task of
executing justice upon the murderer of his father, it is doubtful if a
brother of Bussy would ever have trod the Jacobean stage. Not indeed
that the idea of vengeance being sought for D'Ambois's fate by one of
his nearest kith and kin was without basis in fact. But it was a sister,
not a brother, who had devoted her own and her husband's energies to the
task, though finally the matter had been compromised. De Thou, at the
close of his account of Bussy's murder, relates (vol. <span class="smcap">iii</span>, lib. <span class="smcap">lxvii</span>,
p. 330):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Inde odia capitalia inter Bussianos et Monsorellum exorta:
quorum exercendorum onus in se suscepit Joannes Monlucius
Balagnius, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ducta in matrimonium occisi Bussii sorore, magni
animi</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span><i>foemina quae faces irae maritali subjiciebat: vixque
post novennium certis conditionibus jussu regis inter eum et

<p>In a later passage (vol. <span class="smcap">v</span>, lib. <span class="smcap">cxviii</span>, p. 558) he is even more
explicit. After referring to Bussy's treacherous assassination, he
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Quam injuriam Renata ejus soror, generosa foemina et supra
sexum ambitiosa, a fratre proximisque neglectam, cum inultam
manere impatientissime ferret, Balagnio se ultorem profitente,
spretis suorum monitis in matrimonium cum ipso
consensit.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_XXXVII:2_6" id="FNanchor_XXXVII:2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_XXXVII:2_6" class="fnanchor">[xxxvii:2]</a></p></div>

<p>As these passages first appeared in De Thou's History in the edition of
1620, they cannot have been known to Chapman, when he was writing <i>The
Revenge</i>. But the circumstances must have been familiar to him from some
other source, probably that which supplied the material for the earlier
play. He accordingly introduces Ren&eacute;e D'Ambois (whom he rechristens
Charlotte) with her husband into his drama, but with great skill he
makes her fiery passion for revenge at all costs a foil to the
scrupulous and deliberate procedure of the high-souled Clermont. Like
Hamlet, the latter has been commissioned by the ghost of his murdered
kinsman to the execution of a task alien to his nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span></p><p>Though he sends a challenge to Montsurry, and is not lacking in "the
D'Ambois spirit," the atmosphere in which he lingers with whole-hearted
zest is that of the philosophical schools. He is eager to draw every
chance comer into debate on the first principles of action. Absorbed in
speculation, he is indifferent to external circumstances. As Hamlet at
the crisis of his fate lets himself be shipped off to England, so
Clermont makes no demur when the King, who suspects him of complicity
with Guise's traitorous designs, sends him to Cambray, of which his
brother-in-law, Baligny, has been appointed Lieutenant. When on his
arrival, his sister, the Lieutenant's wife, upbraids him with
"lingering" their "dear brother's wreak," he makes the confession (<a href="#lnumber_Revenge_III_ii_110"><span class="smcap">iii</span>,
ii, 112-15</a>):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">"I repent that ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(By any instigation in th'appearance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brothers spirit made, as I imagin'd)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That e'er I yeelded to revenge his murther."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like Hamlet, too, Clermont, "generous and free from all contriving," is
slow to suspect evil in others, and though warned by an anonymous
letter&mdash;here Chapman draws the incidents from the story of Count
D'Auvergne&mdash;he lets himself be entrapped at a "muster" or review of
troops by the King's emissaries. But the intervention of Guise soon
procures his release. In the dialogue that follows between him and his
patron the influence of Shakespeare's tragedy is unmistakably patent.
The latter is confiding to Clermont his apprehensions for the future,
when the ghost of Bussy appears, and chides his brother for his delay in
righting <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>his wrongs. That the <i>Umbra</i> of the elder D'Ambois is here
merely emulating the attitude of the elder Hamlet's spirit would be
sufficiently obvious, even if it were not put beyond doubt by the
excited dialogue between Guise, to whom the Ghost is invisible, and
Clermont, which is almost a verbal echo of the parallel dialogue between
the Danish Prince and the Queen. This second visitation from the unseen
world at last stirs up Clermont to execute the long-delayed vengeance
upon Montsurry, though he is all but forestalled by Charlotte, who has
donned masculine disguise for the purpose. But hard upon the deed comes
the news of Guise's assassination, and impatient of the earthly barriers
that now sever him from his "lord," Clermont takes his own life in the
approved Stoic fashion. So passes from the scene one of the most
original and engaging figures in our dramatic literature, and the more
thorough our analysis of the curiously diverse elements out of which he
has been fashioned, the higher will be our estimate of Chapman's
creative power.</p>

<p>Was it primarily with the motive of providing Clermont with a plausible
excuse for suicide that Chapman so startlingly transformed the
personality of Henry of Guise? The Duke as he appears in <i>The Revenge</i>
has scarcely a feature in common either with the Guise of history or of
the earlier play. Instead of the turbulent and intriguing noble we see a
"true tenth worthy," who realizes that without accompanying virtues
"greatness is a shade, a bubble," and who drinks in from the lips of
Clermont doctrines "of stability and freedom." To such an extent does
Chapman turn apologist for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>Guise that in a well-known passage (<a href="#lnumber_Revenge_II_i_205"><span class="smcap">ii</span>, i,
205 ff.</a>) he goes out of his way to declare that the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew was "hainous" only "to a brutish sense, But not a manly
reason," and to argue that the blame lay not with "religious Guise," but
with those who had played false to "faith and true religion." So
astonishing is the dramatist's change of front that, but for the
complete lack of substantiating evidence, one would infer that, like
Dryden in the interval between <i>Religio Laici</i> and <i>The Hind and
Panther</i>, he had joined the Church of Rome. In any case the change is
not due to the influence of Grimeston's volume, whence Chapman draws his
material for the account of Guise's last days. For Jean de Serres (whom
the Englishman is here translating) sums up the Duke's character in an
"appreciation," where virtues and faults are impartially balanced and
the latter are in no wise extenuated. It is another tribute to Chapman's
skill, which only close study of the play in relation to its source
brings out, that while he borrows, even to the most minute particulars,
from the annalist, he throws round the closing episodes of Guise's
career a halo of political martyrdom which there is nothing in the
original to suggest. This metamorphosis of Guise is all the more
remarkable, because Monsieur, his former co-partner in villany,
reappears, in the one scene where he figures, in the same ribald,
blustering vein as before, and his death is reported, at the close of
Act <span class="smcap">iv</span>, as a fulfilment of Bussy's dying curse.</p>

<p>While Guise is transfigured, and Monsieur remains his truculent,
vainglorious self, Montsurry has suffered a strange degeneration. It is
sufficiently remarkable, to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>begin with, after his declaration at the
end of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"May both points of heavens strait axeltree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conjoyne in one, before thy selfe and me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to find him ready to receive back Tamyra as his wife, though her sole
motive in rejoining him is to precipitate vengeance on his head. Nor had
anything in the earlier play prepared us for the spectacle of him as a
poltroon, who has "barricado'd" himself in his house to avoid a
challenge, and who shrieks "murther!" at the entrance of an unexpected
visitor. In the light of such conduct it is difficult to regard as
merely assumed his pusillanimity in the final scene, where he at first
grovels before Clermont on the plea that by his baseness he will "shame"
the avenger's victory. And when he does finally nerve himself to the
encounter, and dies with words of forgiveness for Clermont and Tamyra on
his lips, the episode of reconciliation, though evidently intended to be
edifying, is so huddled and inconsecutive as to be well-nigh ridiculous.</p>

<p>Equally ineffective and incongruous are the moralising discourses of
which Bussy's ghost is made the spokesman. It does not seem to have
occurred to Chapman that vindications of divine justice, suitable on the
lips of the elder Hamlet, fell with singular infelicity from one who had
met his doom in the course of a midnight intrigue. In fact, wherever the
dramatist reintroduces the main figures of the earlier play, he falls to
an inferior level. He seems unable to revivify its nobler elements, and
merely repeats the more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>melodramatic and garish effects which refuse to
blend with the classic grace and pathos of Clermont's story. The
audiences before whom <i>The Revenge</i> was produced evidently showed
themselves ill-affected towards such a medley of purely fictitious
creations, and of historical personages and incidents, treated in the
most arbitrary fashion. For Chapman in his dedicatory letter to Sir
Thomas Howard refers bitterly to the "maligners" with whom the play met
"in the scenicall presentation," and asks who will expect "the
autenticall truth of eyther person or action .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a poeme, whose
subject is not truth, but things like truth?" He forgets that "things
like truth" are not attained, when alien elements are forced into
mechanical union, or when well-known historical characters and events
are presented under radically false colours. But we who read the drama
after an interval of three centuries can afford to be less perturbed
than Jacobean playgoers at its audacious juggling with facts, provided
that it appeals to us in other ways. We are not likely indeed to adopt
Chapman's view that the elements that give it enduring value are
"materiall instruction, elegant and sententious excitation to vertue,
and deflection from her contrary." For these we shall assuredly look
elsewhere; it is not to them that <i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i> owes
its distinctive charm. The secret of that charm lies outside the spheres
of "autenticall truth," moral as well as historical. It consists, as it
seems to me, essentially in this&mdash;that the play is one of the most truly
spontaneous products of English "humanism" in its later phase. The same
passionate impulse&mdash;in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>itself so curiously "romantic"&mdash;to revitalise
classical life and ideals, which prompted Chapman's translation of
"Homer, Prince of Poets," is the shaping spirit of this singular
tragedy. Its hero, as we have seen, has strayed into the France of the
Catholic Reaction from some academe in Athens or in imperial Rome. He
is, in truth, far more really a spirit risen from the dead than the
materialised <i>Umbra</i> of his brother. His pervasive influence works in
all around him, so that nobles and courtiers forget for a time the
strife of faction while they linger over some fragrant memory of the
older world. Epictetus with his doctrines of how to live and how to die;
the "grave Greeke tragedian" who drew "the princesse, sweet Antigone";
Homer with his "unmatched poem"; the orators Demetrius Phalerius and
Demades&mdash;these and their like cast a spell over the scene, and transport
us out of the troubled atmosphere of sixteenth-century vendetta into the
"ampler &aelig;ther," the "diviner air," of "the glory that was Greece, the
grandeur that was Rome."</p>

<p>Thus the two <i>Bussy</i> plays, when critically examined, are seen to be
essentially unlike in spite of their external similarity. The plot of
the one springs from that of the other; both are laid in the same period
and <i>milieu</i>; in technique they are closely akin. The diction and
imagery are, indeed, simpler, and the verse is of more liquid cadence in
<i>The Revenge</i> than in <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>. But the true difference lies
deeper,&mdash;in the innermost spirit of the two dramas. <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> is
begotten of "the very torrent, tempest, and whirlwind" of passion; it
throbs with the stress of an over-tumultuous life. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span><i>The Revenge</i> is the
offspring of the meditative impulse, that averts its gaze from the
outward pageant of existence, to peer into the secrets of Man's ultimate
destiny, and his relation to the "Universal," of which he involuntarily
finds himself a part.</p>

<h4>FOOTNOTES:</h4>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_XII:1_4" id="Footnote_XII:1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_XII:1_4"><span class="label">[xii:1]</span></a> Through the kindness of Professor Baker I have seen an
unpublished paper of Mr. P. C. Hoyt, Instructor in Harvard University,
which first calls attention to the combined suggestiveness of three
entries in <i>Henslowe's Diary</i> (Collier's ed.) for any discussion of the
date of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>. In Henslowe's "Enventorey of all the aparell
of the Lord Admirals men, taken the 13<sup>th</sup> of Marcher 1598," is an item,
"Perowes sewt, which W<sup>m</sup> Sley were." (<i>Henslowe's Diary</i>, ed. Collier,
p. 275.) In no extant play save <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> is a character called
Pero introduced. Moreover, Henslowe (pp. 113 and 110) has the following
entries: "Lent unto W<sup>m</sup> Borne, the 19 of novembr 1598 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the some of
xij<sup>s</sup>, w<sup>ch</sup> he sayd y<sup>t</sup> was to Imbrader his hatte for the Gwisse. Lent
W<sup>m</sup> Birde, ales Borne, the 27 of novembr, to bye a payer of sylke
stockens, to playe the Gwisse in xx<sup>s</sup>." Taken by themselves these two
allusions to the "Gwisse" might refer, as Collier supposed, to Marlowe's
<i>The Massacre at Paris</i>. But when combined with the mention of Pero
earlier in the year, they may equally well refer to the Guise in <i>Bussy
D'Ambois</i>. Can <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> have been the unnamed "tragedie" by
Chapman, for the first three Acts of which Henslowe lent him iij<sup>li</sup> on
Jan. 4, 1598, followed by a similar sum on Jan. 8th, "in fulle payment
for his tragedie?" The words which Dekker quotes in <i>Satiromastix</i>, Sc 7
(1602), "For trusty D'Amboys now the deed is done," seem to be a line
from a play introducing D'Ambois. If, however, the play was written
circa 1598, it must have been considerably revised after the accession
of James I to the throne, for the allusions to Elizabeth as an "old
Queene" (1, 2, 12), and to Bussy as being mistaken for "a knight of the
new edition," must have been written after the accession of James I
(<i>Chronicle of the English Drama</i>, 1, 59). But Mr Fleay's further
statement that the words, "Tis leape yeere" (1, 2, 85), "must apply to
the date of production," and "fix the time of representation to 1604,"
is only an ingenious conjecture. If the words "Ile be your ghost to
haunt you," etc (1, 2, 243-244), refer to <i>Macbeth</i>, as I have suggested
in the note on the passage, they point to a revision of the play not
earlier than the latter part of 1606.</p></div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;"><a name="Bussy_Text" id="Bussy_Text"></a>THE TEXT</h2>


<p><i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> was first printed in quarto in 1607 by W. Aspley, and
was reissued in 1608. In 1641, seven years after Chapman's death, Robert
Lunne published another edition in quarto of the play, which, according
to the title-page, was "much corrected and amended by the Author before
his death." This quarto differs essentially from its predecessors. It
omits and adds numerous passages, and makes constant minor changes in
the text. The revised version is not appreciably superior to the
original draft, but, on the evidence of the title-page, it must be
accepted as authoritative. It was reissued by Lunne, with a different
imprint, in 1646, and by J. Kirton, with a new title-page, in 1657.
Copies of the 1641 quarto differ in unimportant details such as
<i>articular</i>, <i>articulat</i>, for evidently some errors were corrected as
the edition passed through the press. Some copies of the 1646 quarto
duplicate the uncorrected copies of the 1641 quarto.</p>

<p>In a reprint of Chapman's Tragedies and Comedies, published by J.
Pearson in 1873, the anonymous editor purported to "follow mainly" the
text of 1641, but collation with the originals shows that he transcribed
that of 1607, substituting the later version where the two quartos
differed, but retaining elsewhere the spelling of the earlier one. Nor
is his list of variants complete. There have been also three editions of
the play in modernized spelling by C. W. Dilke in 1814, R. H. Shepherd
in 1874, and W. L. Phelps in 1895, particulars of which are given in the
Bibliography. The present edition is therefore the first to reproduce
the authoritative text unimpaired. The original spelling has been
retained, though capitalization has been modernized, and the use of
italics for personal names has not been preserved. But the chaotic
punctuation has been throughout revised, though, except to remove
ambiguity, I have not interfered with one distinctive feature, an
exceptionally frequent use of brackets. In a few cases of doubtful
interpretation, the old punctuation has been given in the footnotes.</p>

<p>Dilke, though the earliest of the annotators, contributed most to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>the
elucidation of allusions and obsolete phrases. While seeking to
supplement his and his successors' labours in this direction, I have
also attempted a more perilous task&mdash;the interpretation of passages
where the difficulty arises from the peculiar texture of Chapman's
thought and style. Such a critical venture seems a necessary preliminary
if we are ever to sift truth from falsehood in Dryden's
indictment&mdash;indolently accepted by many critics as conclusive&mdash;of <i>Bussy
D'Ambois</i>.</p>

<p>The group of quartos of 1641, 1646, and 1657, containing Chapman's
revised text, is denoted by the symbol "B"; those of 1607 and 1608 by
"A." In the footnotes all the variants contained in A are given except
in a few cases where the reading of A has been adopted in the text and
that of B recorded as a variant. I have preferred the reading of A to B,
when it gives an obviously better sense, or is metrically superior. I
have also included in the Text fifty lines at the beginning of Act <span class="smcap">ii</span>,
Scene 2, which are found only in A. Some slight conjectural emendations
have been attempted which are distinguished by "emend. ed." in the
footnotes. In these cases the reading of the quartos, if unanimous, is
denoted by "Qq."</p>

<p>In the quartos the play is simply divided into five Acts. These I have
subdivided into Scenes, within which the lines have been numbered to
facilitate reference. The stage directions in B are numerous and
precise, and I have made only a few additions, which are enclosed in
brackets. The quartos vary between <i>Bussy</i> and <i>D'Ambois</i>, and between
<i>Behemoth</i> and <i>Spiritus</i>, as a prefix to speeches. I have kept to the
former throughout in either case.</p>

<p>The immediate source of the play has not been identified, but in the
<i>Introduction</i> attention has been drawn to passages in the writings of
Bussy's contemporaries, especially Brant&ocirc;me and Marguerite de Valois,
which narrate episodes similar to those in the earlier Acts. Extracts
from De Thou's <i>Historiae sui temporis</i> and Rosset's <i>Histoires
Tragiques</i>, which tell the tale of Bussy's amorous intrigue and his
assassination, have also been reprinted as an Appendix. But both these
narratives are later than the play. Seneca's representation in the
<i>Hercules &OElig;taeus</i> of the Greek hero's destruction by treachery gave
Chapman suggestions for his treatment of the final episode in Bussy's
career (cf. <span class="smcap">v</span>, 4, 100-108, and note).</p>

<p class="center"><i>For the meaning of single words see the Glossary.</i></p>


<p><a href="#Bussy_Prologue"><b>Prologue.</b></a> The allusions in these lines can be only partially explained.
The play had evidently been performed, not long before 1641, by a
company which had not possessed original acting rights in it. The
performance had been successful (cf. ll. 3-4 "the grace of late It did
receive"), and the "King's men," while not claiming a monopoly in it,
nor seeking to detract from their rivals' merits, felt bound to revive
the play on their own account, lest they should seem to be letting their
claim go by default. It is possible that in ll. 11-12, they refer to a
performance that in vindication of this claim they had given at Court,
while, as further evidence of their priority of interest, they remind
the audience of the actors belonging to the company who had appeared in
the title-r&ocirc;le. Nathaniel Field (l. 15), born in 1587, had as a boy been
one of the "Children of the Queen's Revels," and had performed in
Jonson's <i>Cynthia's Revels</i>, 1600, and <i>Poetaster</i>, 1601. He seems to
have joined the King's players soon after 1614, and his name appears in
the list of "the principall actors in all these playes" prefixed to the
first Shakespearean Folio of 1623. Not long after this period, Field,
who by his <i>Woman is a Weathercock</i> (1612) and his <i>Amends for Ladies</i>
(1618) had made a reputation as a dramatist as well as an actor, is
believed to have retired from the stage, though he lived till 1633. If,
however, he did not appear as Bussy till after 1614, when the play had
already been at least seven years, perhaps considerably longer, on the
boards, it can scarcely be said with truth that his "action first did
give it name" (l. 16). His successor in the part, whom the "gray beard"
(l. 18) of advancing years had now disqualified, cannot be identified;
but the "third man" (l. 21) is probably Ilyard Swanston, who, according
to Fleay (<i>Biog. Chron. of Drama</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i</span>, p. 60), was one of the
"King's men" from 1625 to 1642. His <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>impersonation of Bussy is
favourably referred to by Edmund Gayton in his <i>Festivous Notes upon Don
Quixote</i> (1654), p. 25 and his previous r&ocirc;le of "Richard" (l. 23) may
have been that of Ricardo in Massinger's <i>Picture</i>, which he had played
in 1629 (cf. Phelps, <i>Geo. Chap.</i> p. 125). The earlier editors thought
that Charles Hart was here alluded to, but Wright in his <i>Historia
Histrionica</i> states it was the part of the Duchess in Shirley's
<i>Cardinal</i>, licensed 1641, that first gave him any reputation. Hence he
cannot at this date have performed Bussy; his fame in the part was made
after the Restoration (cf. Introduction, <a href="#Page_xxv">p. xxv</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#Page_5"><b>5-6</b></a>, <a href="#Bussy_I_i">1-33</a>. <b>Fortune .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. port.</b> This opening speech of Bussy illustrates
the difficult compression of Chapman's style and the diversion of his
thought from strictly logical sequence by his excessive use of simile.
He begins (ll. 1-4) by emphasising the paradoxical character of human
affairs, in which only those escape poverty who are abnormal, while it
is among the necessitous that worthily typical representatives of the
race must be sought. The former class, under the designation of "great
men," are then (after a parenthetical comparison with cedars waxing
amidst tempests) likened to statuaries who are satisfied if the exterior
of the Colossus they are creating is sufficiently imposing; they are
then (by an awkward transition of the imagery) likened to the statues
themselves (l. 15) "heroique" in form but "morter, flint, and lead"
within. Chapman's meaning is here obvious enough, but it is a singular
canon of &aelig;sthetics that estimates the worth of a statue by the materials
out of which it is made. In l. 18 a new thought is started, that of the
transitoriness of life, and the perishable nature of its gifts, and as
the ocean-voyager needs a stay-at-home pilot to steer him safely into
port, so the adventurer in "the waves of glassie glory" (ll. 29-30) is
bidden look to "vertue" for guidance to his desired haven&mdash;not exactly
the conclusion to be expected from the opening lines of the speech.</p>

that this refers "to the date of production, as Bussy's introduction at
Court was in 1569, not a Leap Year," and that it "fixes the time of
representation to 1604." See <a href="#Introduction"><i>Introduction</i></a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_22"><b>22</b></a>, <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_I_ii_110">110</a>. <b>the groome-porters.</b> Chapman here transfers to the French Court

<p><a href="#Page_23"><b>23</b></a>, <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_I_ii_120">123</a>. <b>the guiserd.</b> The play on words here is not clear; "guiserd" may
be a variant of "gizzard," in which case it would mean the Duke's
throat. This is more probable than a "jingling allusion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
goose-herd or gozzard," which Dilke suggests.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_24"><b>24</b></a>, <a href="#lnumber_Bussy_I_ii_145">149</a>. <b>the Knights ward.</b> Dilke thought that the allusion here was to
the "poor knights of Windsor," but it really refers to a part of the
"Counter" prison in London. Cf. <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, <span class="smcap">v</span>, 2, 54, where Wolf
says of Sir Petronel Flash, "The knight will i' the Knights-Ward, doe

on words here. <i>Descant</i> in music is the melodious accompaniment to a
simple theme, the <i>plainsong</i> or <i>ground</i>. Hence arises the derived
meaning, <i>a variation on any theme</i>, <i>a comment</i>, often of a censorious
kind. This, as well as the original meaning, is implied here, while
<i>ground</i> has, of course, its usual as well as its technical sense.</p>

reference to Banquo's ghost? <i>Macbeth</i> was probably produced in 1606,
the year before <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i> was printed.</p>

<p><a name="note_p29_stagedir" id="note_p29_stagedir"></a><a href="#Page_29"><b>29</b></a>. <b><a href="#Bussy_II_i">Henry, Guise, Montsurry and Attendants.</a></b> The Qq of 1607 and 1608,
instead of <i>Montsurry and Attendants</i>, read <i>Beaumond, Nuncius</i>.
<i>Nuncius</i> is a mistake, as he does not enter till after l. 24.
<i>Beaumond</i> is evidently a courtier, who speaks ll. 105-107 (<i>Such a life
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of men</i>), and who goes out with the King after l. 206. In 1641 and
later Qq it was apparently thought desirable to leave out this
"single-speech" character and transfer his words to Montsurry; but by an
oversight <i>Beau.</i> was left prefixed to the second half of l. 105, and
the S. D., <i>Exit Rex cum Beau.</i>, was retained after l. 206. The editor
has therefore substituted <i>Mont.</i> for <i>Beau.</i> in either case. Montsurry
being thus present at the pardon of Bussy, the 1641 and later Qq leave
out ll. 1-50 of the next Scene wherein <i>inter alia</i> Montsurry speaks of
the pardon as yet undecided, and Guise enters to announce it to him.</p>

<p>Dilke in his edition in 1814 thought <i>Beaumond</i> a misprint for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><i>Beaupre</i>, who appears in other scenes, and whom he took to be a man,
instead of a woman. Hence he reads <i>Montsurry, Beaupre and Attendants</i>
both here and after l. 206. The other editors have not realized that
there is any discrepancy to be explained.</p>

is bidden appear. Dilke substitutes <i>oh</i> for <i>or</i> (the reading of all

but it is difficult to extract a satisfactory sense from what follows.

<p><i>The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois</i> was printed in quarto in 1613 by T. S.
for John Helme. No reprint appeared till 1873, when it was included in
the edition of Chapman's Tragedies and Comedies published by J. Pearson.
The text of the quarto was reproduced, with the original spelling and
punctuation, but with a few errors. There have been two later editions
in modernized spelling, and with slight emendations, by R. H. Shepherd
in 1874, and W. L. Phelps in 1895.</p>

<p>In the present edition the text of the quarto has been reproduced, with
some additional emendations, and the original spelling has been
retained. As regards punctuation, the use of capital letters and
italics, and the division of the Acts into Scenes, the same methods have
been followed as in the case of <i>Bussy D'Ambois</i>.</p>

<p>The story of a plot by Bussy D'Ambois's kinsfolk to avenge his murder
is, in the main, of Chapman's own invention. But he had evidently read
an account similar to that given later by De Thou of the design
entertained for a time by Bussy's sister Ren&eacute;e (whom Chapman calls
Charlotte) and her husband, Baligny, to take vengeance on Montsurry.
Clermont D'Ambois is himself a fictitious character, but the episodes in
which he appears in Acts <span class="smcap">II-IV</span> are drawn from the account of the
treacherous proceedings against the Count d'Auvergne in Edward
Grimeston's translation of Jean de Serres's <i>Inventaire G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de
l'Histoire de France</i>. This narrative, however, is not by De Serres, but
by Pierre Matthieu, whose <i>Histoire de France</i> was one of the sources
used by Grimeston for events later than 1598.</p>

<p>The portraiture of Clermont throughout the play as the high-souled
philosopher is inspired by Epictetus's delineation in his <i>Discourses</i>
of the ideal Stoic. But in his reluctance to carry out his duty of
revenge he is evidently modelled upon Hamlet. In Act <span class="smcap">v</span>, Scene i, the
influence of Shakespeare's tragedy is specially manifest.</p>

<p>The Scenes in Act <span class="smcap">v</span> relating to the assassination of Guise are based
upon Grimeston's translation of De Serres's <i>Inventaire G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>.</p>

<p>The passages in Grimeston's volume which recount the Duke's murder, and
those which tell the story of the Count d'Auvergne, are reprinted as an
Appendix.</p>

<p>The frontispiece to this volume, the Ch&acirc;teau of La Coutanci&egrave;re, at which
Bussy D'Ambois was killed, is reproduced from an illustration in A.
Joubert's <i>Louis de Clermont</i>.</p>

<p>
Since workes of this kinde have beene lately esteemed<br />
worthy the patronage of some of our worthiest<br />
Nobles, I have made no doubt to preferre this of mine<br />
to your undoubted vertue and exceeding true noblesse,<br />
as contayning matter no lesse deserving your reading,               <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
and excitation to heroycall life, then any such late dedication.<br />
Nor have the greatest Princes of Italie and other<br />
countries conceived it any least diminution to their greatnesse<br />
to have their names wing'd with these tragicke<br />
plumes, and disperst by way of patronage through the               <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
most noble notices of Europe.<br />
<br />
Howsoever, therefore, in the sc&aelig;nicall presentation it<br />
might meete with some maligners, yet, considering even<br />
therein it past with approbation of more worthy judgements,<br />
the ballance of their side (especially being held                  <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
by your impartiall hand) I hope will to no graine abide<br />
the out-weighing. And for the autenticall truth of eyther<br />
person or action, who (worth the respecting) will expect<br />
it in a poeme, whose subject is not truth, but things like<br />
truth? Poore envious soules they are that cavill at truths         <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
want in these naturall fictions: materiall instruction, elegant<br />
and sententious excitation to vertue, and deflection<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>from her contrary, being the soule, lims, and limits of an<br />
autenticall tragedie. But whatsoever merit of your full<br />
countenance and favour suffers defect in this, I shall soone       <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
supply with some other of more generall account; wherein<br />
your right vertuous name made famous and preserved to<br />
posteritie, your future comfort and honour in your present<br />
acceptation and love of all vertuous and divine expression<br />
may be so much past others of your rancke encreast, as             <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
they are short of your judiciall ingenuitie, in their due<br />
estimation.<br />
<br />
For howsoever those ignoble and sowre-brow'd<br />
worldlings are carelesse of whatsoever future or present<br />
opinion spreads of them; yet (with the most divine                 <span class="linenum"><a name="Revenge_letter_l35" id="Revenge_letter_l35">35</a></span><br />

born before 1594, was the second son of the first Earl of Suffolk. He
was created a Knight of the Bath in January, 1605, and in May, 1614, was
appointed Master of the Horse to Charles, Prince of Wales. In 1622 he
became Viscount Andover, and in 1626 Earl of Berkshire. He held a number
of posts till the outbreak of the Civil War, and after the Restoration
was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Charles II, and Privy
Councillor. He died on July 16, 1669. His daughter Elizabeth married
Dryden, and his sixth son, Sir Robert Howard, became distinguished as a
dramatic writer and critic. Chapman addresses to this patron one of the
Sonnets appended to his translation of the <i>Iliad</i>, in which he compares
him to Antilochus, and calls him "valiant, and mild, and most
ingenious."</p>

remarkable encomium was Edward de Vere (1550-1604), seventeenth Earl of
Oxford. He was educated at Cambridge, and from an early age became a
prominent figure at the Court of Elizabeth, who, it was said in 1573,
"delighteth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>more in his personage, and his dancing and valiantness,
than any other." In 1575 he paid a visit to Italy, and it is apparently
to an episode on his return journey in the spring of 1576 that reference
is made here, and in the following lines. The portrait here drawn of him
is too flattering, as he was violent in temper and extravagant, but the
Earl's literary gifts merited the praise of Chapman. Puttenham and Meres
speak highly of him as a writer of comedy, and Webbe pays a tribute to
his excellence in "the rare devises of poetry." Over twenty of his
lyrics survive, chiefly in anthologies.</p>

was John Casimir, Count Palatine, who in the autumn of 1575 entered into
alliance with the Huguenots and invaded France, but, after suffering a
check at the hands of the Duke of Guise, made a truce and retired. The
incident here spoken of apparently took place in the spring of the next
year (cf. the previous note). Why, however, does Chapman introduce it
here, and how did he know of it? Can he, immediately after leaving
Oxford, which he entered, according to Wood, "in 1574 or thereabouts,"
have gone in Oxford's train to the Continent?</p>

<p><a href="#Page_238"><b>238</b></a>, <a href="#lnumber_Revenge_III_iv_110">112</a>. <b>a Sir John Smith.</b> Though alluded to in so contemptuous a way,
this Sir John Smith appears to be the noted soldier of fortune,
diplomatist, and military writer, who lived from about 1534 to 1607.
After serving for many years in continental armies, in 1574 he became an
agent of the English government, and took part in various diplomatic
missions. In 1590 he published "Certain Discourses concerning the formes
and effects of divers sorts of Weapons" and dedicated the work to the
English nobility, whom he calls in one part of his "proeme" the "verie
eyes, eares and language of the king, and the bodie of the watch, and
redresse of the Commonwealth." Hence perhaps the allusion in l. 113 to
"common Nobles fashions."</p>

<h3>DE LA MORT PITOYABLE DU VALEUREUX LYSIS</h3>


<p>Under this title, in the 17th of the series of tales founded on fact
which he calls <i>Les Histoires Tragiques de Nostre Temps</i>, Fran&ccedil;ois de
Rosset relates in 1615 the story of Bussy's death. In the Preface to the
volume he declares: "Ce ne sont pas des contes de l'Antiquit&eacute;
fabuleuse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ce sont des histoires autant veritables que tristes et
funestes. Les noms de la pluspart des personnages sont seulement
desguisez en ce Th&eacute;atre, &agrave; fin de <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>n'affliger pas tant les familles de
ceux qui en ont donn&eacute; le suject, puis qu'elles en sont assez afflig&eacute;es."
We thus find that the outlines of the story of "Lysis" tally with what
we know about Bussy from other sources, and Rosset not improbably
preserves details omitted by the historians of the period.</p>

<p>Lysis, Rosset tells us, was sprung from one of the most noble and
renowned Houses of France. At seventeen he had acquired an extraordinary
reputation for bravery, which increased till "jamais la France depuis le
valeureux Roland, ne porta un tel Palladin." Afterwards "il vint &agrave; la
cour du Prince qui venoit de quiter une Couronne estrangere, pour
recevoir celle qui luy appartenoit par les droits de la loy Salique, [i.
e. Henry III, who gave up the throne of Poland on succeeding to that of
France.] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Les rares dons dont il estoit accomply luy acquirent tant de
part aux bonnes graces du premier Prince du sang Royal, qu'il estoit
tousiours aupres de luy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mais l'envie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tous les jours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. faisait
de mauvais rapports a sa Maiest&eacute; de Lysis, de sorte qu'elle le voyoit
d'aussi mauvais &oelig;il, que l'autre Prince, son proche parent, faisoit
conte de sa prou&euml;sse."</p>

<p>He had never been the victim of love, but he was instantly captivated by
the beautiful eyes of a lady whom he met at an assembly at the house of
a Judge in one of the towns of which he was Governor.</p>

<p>"Ceste beaut&eacute;, pour le respect que je dois &agrave; ceux a qui elle
appartenoit, sera nomm&eacute;e Sylvie.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cette dame .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. estoit mari&eacute;e avec un
grand Seigneur, jeune, vaillan, sage, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>discret et courtois." She would
not at first gratify her lover's passion, though she granted him "de
petites privautez," which only fanned the flame. He wrote her a letter
in which he declared that if she refused him her favour, it meant his
sentence of death. She replied in a temporising manner that when he had
given proofs of his fidelity, she would decide as to what she ought to
do. Rosset asserts that these two letters are not invented, but that he
obtained them from a friend who had made a collection of such epistles,
and who "a est&eacute; curieux de s&ccedil;avoir le nom des personnes qui les ont
escrites."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he continues, "elle donne le vray moyen &agrave; Lysis de la voir,
sans le souciet qu'on en parle, pourveu que sa conscience la deffende.
Et particulierement ce fut en un jardin qui est &agrave; l'un des fauxbourgs de
la ville." Some tale-bearers, putting the worst construction on their
behaviour, gave information to Lisandre, the husband of Sylvie, but he
refused to credit anything to the dishonour of his wife. To stop gossip,
however, he took her with him to a house he had not far from the town.
But the lovers communicated with one another by messengers, till
Lisandre's departure on a journey removed all obstacle to their
intercourse. "Ce Seigneur avait des affaires hors de la province o&ugrave; il
faisoit pour lors sa demeure. Pour les terminer, il s'y achemine au
grand contentement de Sylvie, qui neantmoins contrefaisoit la dolente &agrave;
son depart &amp; le sommoit de revenir le plustot qu'il luy seroit possible,
tandis que dans son ame elle prioit &agrave; Dieu que son voyage fust aussi
long que celuy d'Ulysse." When he was gone, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>she immediately sent for
Lysis, and they spent two or three days in transports of delight, though
she continued to safeguard her honour.</p>

<p>On Lisandre's return the King, instigated by the enemies of Lysis,
reproached the former for tamely enduring dishonour, and bade him never
reappear in the royal presence till he had wiped out the stain. Lisandre
therefore offered his wife the choice of three courses. She was to
swallow poison, or die beneath his dagger, or write to Lysis, telling
him that Lisandre was still absent, and begging him to come to her.
After a struggle Sylvie wrote the fatal missive, and Lysis, though at
the castle gate he was overcome by a premonition of evil and almost
turned back, was obedient to her summons, and entered her chamber
unarmed. The final scene is thus described.</p>

<p>"A l'instant il se void environn&eacute; d'une douzaine d'hommes armez, qui de
pistolets, qui d'espees nues, et qui de hallebardes. Lisandre est parmy
eux, qui luy crie: 'C'est maintenant que tu recevras le salaire de la
honte que tu as faicte &agrave; ma maison. Ce disant, il lasche un pistolet, et
luy perce un bras. Les autres le chargent avec leurs halebardes, et avec
leurs espees.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Le valeureux Lysis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. avec un escabeau qu'il tient en
main donne si rudement sur la teste de l'un de ses adversaires, qu'il en
fait sortir la cervelle. Il en assomme encores deux autres: mais que
peut-il faire contre tant de gens, &amp; ainsi desarm&eacute; qu'il est? Son corps
perc&eacute; comme un crible, verse un grand ruisseau de sang. En fin il se
jette sur Lisandre, et bien <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>que par derriere on luy baille cent coups
de poignards, il le prend, et le souleve, prest &agrave; le jetter du haut en
bas d'une fenestre, si tous les autres ensemble, en se jettant sur luy,
ne l'en eussent empesch&eacute;. Il les escarte encores &agrave; coups de poings &amp;
neantmoins il sesent tousiours percer de part en part. Voyant qu'il ne
pouvoit eschapper la mort, il s'approche de la fenestre &amp; puis, tout
sanglant qu'il est, il saute legerement en bas. Mais, &ocirc; malheur, il
portoit un accoustrement decoupp&eacute;, qui est arrest&eacute; par le fer d'un
treillis. Ses adversaires le voyant ainsi empestr&eacute; comme un autre
Absalon, luy donnent tant de coups de halebardes, qu'&agrave; la fin, ils
privent le monde du plus grand courage, et de la plus grande valeur du
siecle. O valeureux Lysis! que je plains l'injustice de ton sort!"</p>

<p>It will be seen that Rosset's account of the final episodes, beginning
with the intervention of the King, agrees, in the main details, with the
following description by De Thou, which appeared in 1620, in the Genevan
edition of the <i>Historiae Sui Temporis</i>, lib. <span class="smcap">lxviii</span>, p. 330 (vol. <span class="smcap">iii</span>,
p. 675, of Buckley's edition, 1733).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_310:1_9" id="Footnote_310:1_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_310:1_9"><span class="label">[310:1]</span></a> While the Duke of Anjou was still at Court, he had
shown in jest to the King, a letter which had been written to him by
Louis de Clermont Bussy d'Ambois. In this letter, owing to the very
intimate terms on which he stood with his young patron, he told him that
he had enclosed and caught in his net the hind of a mighty hunter. Thus
he termed the wife of Charles de Chambes, Count of Montsoreau, on whom
the Duke had conferred that title a short time before, at the
recommendation of Bussy. This letter the King had kept, and as he had
long been annoyed by Bussy's insolent arrogance and his petulant temper,
he availed himself of this opportunity of avenging the old insults he
had received from him. Even while he was at Court, he had been guilty of
every sort of insult to nobles and Court ladies, trusting to his prowess
as a swordsman, by which he made himself a terror to every one. So also
after he had betaken himself to the district of Anjou, occupying, as he
did, the citadel of Angers, the most powerful stronghold in all that
district, and commanding the populous city, he had made himself a burden
to the townspeople and the whole province by his frequent exactions,
generally made on his own authority, without consulting the Duke of
Anjou. He had thus stirred up against himself a deep-seated and
universal hatred.
</p><p>
Therefore the King secretly called aside Montsoreau, who was then at
Court, and showed him Bussy's letter, and added that, as he was
extremely solicitous about his family honour and his dignity, he did not
wish to conceal so insulting a matter from him; for the rest he ought to
know himself what measures it behoved him to take under such
circumstances. Without further words he dismissed Montsoreau. The Count,
stung to the quick by so grave an injury to his honour, and excited by
the admonitions of the King, which he interpreted as reproaches for his
cowardice, should he tamely bear the insult, at once flew home, in the
greatest secrecy, so that Bussy should not know of his return. By a
stratagem he arranged that a letter should be sent by his wife to Bussy,
making a secret assignation with him at La Coutanci&egrave;re, which was a
pleasure-resort and convenient for hunting purposes. When Bussy came
there with his associate Colasseau at nightfall on the nineteenth of
August, he was fallen upon by Montsoreau and other armed men. Yet, such
was his coolness, that though he was one against many, he at first by
mighty exertions discomfited his assailants. At length, overcome by
numbers, and breath failing him in the struggle, he tried to throw
himself out of the window into the castle-moat, but was stabbed in the
back and killed.</p></div>

and affections of good men which respected their honours. Many means
were attempted but they were incountred with great difficulties and
crosses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The surest meanes (&amp; that wherein there was least trouble
and scandall) was the mustring of the Duke of Vandosmes company.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
D'Eurre who prest Murat (Treasorer extraordinary of the warres) to paie
his company a muster, intreated the count of Auvergne to see it, to the
ende hee might assure the King that hee had gallant men and good horses,
and that all his companions should be wonderfully honored with the
presence of their coronell. 'I will part to morrowe' sayd the Count of
Auvergne 'to hunt at Alezou, and will returne againe on Monday at night;
I pray you bee heere at super, and lodge your company at Normain, to the
ende that the next day, after that wee have dronke, runne at the ring,
and dined, we may see it.'</p>

<p>(1048.) "This was done as he had appointed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D'Eurre came to Clermont
on Monday at night, and goes unto him where he supped in one of their
houses that managed this businesse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The next day, the ninth of
November, the morning was spent in running at the ring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They went to
dinner, and it was well observed that the Count of Auvergne had some
distrust. He hath since confest that hee was ready to call the two
brothers of Murat into his cabinet, and to cause them to be searcht, for
that he was well advertised that they alwayes carryed the Kings letters
and his commandments. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>But a great resolution, thinking that there is no
more harme in fearing then in the thing that causeth feare, feares
extremely to make shewe that hee hath any feare. After dinner D'Eurre
asked, 'If it pleased him to go to horse to see the musters.' He
answered him; 'That it should be presently, and that he should use
speed.' He retyred himselfe soone after into his cabinet and went downe
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mounted upon a Scottish horse (which Vitry had given him) the which
would have outrunne all the horses of France. He would not attend the
other noblemen for that he distrusted them, having an intent to passe
on, if he found them not ready. But beeing come to the place, he found
the company in battell. This great diligence made him somewhat jealous,
and they might perceive him, that, pulling up his cloake, he drewe his
sword foure fingers out, yet without any amazement. D'Eurre, seeing him
make even the reynes of his horse, came to him trotting, with his hat in
his hand, and hearing him sweare with a great oath that he had been very
dilligent, 'You may see, my lord' (answered he) 'I have caused my
companions to advance, for that I would not trouble you with
attendance.' 'Monsieur D'Eurre' (replyed the Earle) 'you are one of my
friends, I cannot make any long stay here.' To whome D'Eurre said: 'All
my companions are not yet here, but, if it please you, you shall see
this troupe, and judge of the whole by a part.' Hereupon he sees some
horsemen come and demands what they were. D'Eurre told him: 'That it was
Nerestan, who had beene at Rion <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>about a sute of his daughters.' He
beleeved it, for he knewe that Nerestan had stayd some dayes at Rion and
yet his heart began to suspect more. But it was too late, hee was
environed on every side, and hardly can one resist many. Nerestan
lighted to salute him, and having entertayned him with some discourse
uppon the occasion of his staye at Rion, or of his returne to Court, he
went presently to horse-back, and thrust on one of the lackquaies with
his foote, for a signe and token of the beginning of the execution.</p>

<p>"One of Nerestans three lackquaies takes holde of his horse by the
bridle. D'Eurre, seeing that Nerestan had taken the right side to salute
the Count of Auvergne, went unto the left, and laying hold with his hand
uppon the hilt of his sword, he sayd unto him that hee had commandement
from the King to take him. The other two laquais pulled him so roughly
from his horse, as he had like to have fallen to the ground; hee was
mooved to see himselfe so intreated by laquais, intreating D'Eurre to
cause two of his companions to light, and that hee might not see those
rascalls any more. Nerestan sayd unto him that they were soldiars so
attyred to serve the King in this action. A peece shott into the ayre by
chance made him to doubt worse measure, so as hee intreated D'Eurre that
he would not use his pistolet. D'Eurre freed him from these
apprehensions, intreating him to resolve upon the Kings will, and not to
force them to intreat him otherwise than they desired. 'Well,' said hee,
'I yeeld, what will you have mee to doe?' 'That you mount <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>upon the
trompets horse,' sayd D'Eurre. It was feared that he would not have
suffered himselfe to bee taken so easily nor so quietly, as wee have
seene many great courages choose rather to be cut in peeces then to see
themselves reserved for some shamefull end, and others that have
willingly dyed, for that they would not die by force. When as he sees
himselfe in the toyles invironed on al sides .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hee sayd, 'Ah! in the
Divels name, I doubted all this.' Being mounted upon the trompets nagg,
they conduct him presently to Aigueperse. Before hee had gone a hundred
paces, he intreated D'Eurre to lend him one of his troupe, to carry some
message of his remembrance, and of his miserie, to a ladie that attended
him. De Pleche had the charge. Shee who had not prepared her heart to
withstand the assaults of a most extreame and sensible griefe, tooke
D'Eurre for the object, against whome shee poured forth the furie of her
passions. 'If I knew' (sayd shee unto this gentleman) 'that I might save
him in forcing through your troupe, I would willingly doe it, and if I
had but tenne men of my courage and resolution, you should not carrie
him where you thinke. But I will never die till I have given D'Eurre a
hundred shott with a pistoll, and to Murat a hundred blowes with a
sword.' These were the passions of her love, transported with a
resolution beyond her sexe, and which did participate of a man, of a
troubled mind, and of love. This last makes miracles of marvells and
marvells of miracles, in wills that are equally toucht with his
inspirations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shee loved him well, and was well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>beloved: for the
Count of Auvergne hath been heard say, that if the King did set him at
libertie, and send him back to his house, uppon condition that hee
should not see this ladie, hee would rather desire to die. Shee
presently ordered the affaires of her house, the disposition of her
furniture, and the retreat of her servants. This passion going from the
memorie to the thought, from the thought to the heart, from the heart to
the eyes, made her to powre forth so many teares, as shee lost the sight
of one eye for a tyme.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"All the way hee seemed no more afflicted, then when hee was at
libertie. He tould youthfull and idle tales of his love, and the
deceiving of ladies. Hee shott in a harquebuse at birds, wherein hee was
so perfect and excellent, as hee did kill larkes as they were flying.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>(1050.) "We may observe in this apprehension many things that may breed
admiration and amazement, and which shewe that men do in vaine furnish
themselves with wisedome against Heaven and with intelligences against
the King. The Count of Auvergne had advertisements from all places that
they should take him, and that the Kings pensioners were in the field to
that effect. His most inward and neerest friends and, among others
Florac, knewe it, and said nothing unto him, preferring his duty to his
Prince before all affection. The Constable was also as well informed
thereof as any other and yet he made no shewe thereof.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His duty
prescribed him a law to all the bounds of nature; so there is not any
one but is more bound to the service of the King and his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>country then
to his owne health, or to that of his children. A gentleman, being at
his table, speaking of this taking, said, 'Sir, if the King should
command mee to take you, I would doe it, although I bee your most humble
servant, that you march in the first rankes of greatnesse in the realm,
and that all things touching armes, depend upon your commandments.' 'I
beleeve it' (answered the Constable) 'else you should do ill, for the
King is both your King and mine. I am your friend.' There is no love nor
affection to dispence any one from the Kings commandments."</p>


<p class="sectctr">II</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Grimeston's Translation of J. de Serres's Narrative of the Murder of the
Duke of Guise in his Inventaire General</span></p>

<p>The King determines to get rid of Guise, "this newe starre in the East
whom the people worshipped already." (722.) "Hee hath caused bookes to
bee printed in favour of the lawfull succession of the House of Lorraine
to the Crowne. At the Barricades this voice was heard: 'It is no longer
time to dally, let us lead my lord to Reimes.' He hath suffered himselfe
to be saluted by the people, with cries and acclamations which belong
only to the Soveraigne Prince."</p>

<p>The Duke, scenting danger, thinks of absenting himself from the meetings
of the Estates, but is dissuaded.</p>

<p>(723.) "The Archbishop of Lion, attending a Cardinals <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>hatt within a few
dayes from Rome, 'Retyring your selfe from the Estates' (said he unto
him) 'you shall beare the blame to have abandoned France in so important
an occasion, and your enemies, making their profit of your absence, wil
sone overthrowe al that which you have with so much paine effected for
the assurance of religion.'</p>

<p>"Man doth often loose his judgement upon the point of his fal.
Advertisements were come to him from all parts, both within and without
the realme, from Rome, Spaine, Lorraine and Savoye, that a bloodie
catastrophe would dissolve the assemblie. The almanakes had well
observed it: it was generally bruted in the Estates, that the execution
should be on Saint Thomas day. The eve before his death, the Duke
himselfe sitting downe to dinner, found a scroule under his napkin,
advertising him of this secret ambush. But (as ambition blinds those
whome shee hath raised up to the pies nest, and the furie of Gods
judgements confounds such as trust in their authoritie) he writ
underneath, with his owne hand 'They dare not'; and threw it under the
table.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Guise, following the councell of the Cardinall Morosin, had
the one and twentith of December incensed the King a new by some bold
and presumptous speeches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The King had the two and twentith day
following prepared seven of his five and fortie (they were gentlemen
whome hee had appointed to be neere his person, besides the ordinarie
archers of his gard) to execute his will, and by many dispatches had
assured <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>those townes which hee held to bee most mutinous. The three and
twentith he assembles his Councell somewhat more early in the morning
then was usuall, having a devotion to go after dinner, and to spend the
holidayes at our Ladie of Clery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Duke of Guise comes, and
attending the beginning of the councell sends for a handkercher: (the
groome of [724] his chamber had forgotten to put one into his hose.)
Pericart, his secretarie, not daring to commit this new advertisement to
any mans report, ties a note to one of the corners thereof, saying,
'Come forth and save your selfe, else you are but a dead man.' But they
stay the page that carried it. Larchant, captaine of the Kings gard,
causeth an other to be given unto him with all speed by Saint Prix, the
chiefe grome of the Kings chamber. The Castle gates are shutt, and the
Councell sits about eight of the clocke.</p>

<p>"The spirit of man doth often prophecie of the mischeefe that doth
pursue him. So whilest they dispute of a matter propounded by
Petremolle, the Duke feeles strange alterations, and extraordinary
distemperatures, and, amidest his distrust, a great fainting of his
heart. Saint Prix presents unto him some prunes of Brignolles and
raisins of the sunne. Hee eats, and thereupon the King calls him into
his Cabinet by Revoll, one of the secretaries of his Estate, as it were
to confer with him about some secret of importance. The Duke leaves the
Councell to passe unto the Cabinet: and as he did lift up the tapistrie
with one hand to enter, they charge him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>with their swords, daggers, and
pertuisans: yet not with so great violence, but he shewed the murtherers
the last endeavours of an invincible valour and courage.</p>

<p>"Thus lived and thus died Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise: a Prince
worthie to be in the first rankes of Princes, goodly, great, tall of
proportion, amiable of countenance, great of courage, readie in the
execution of his enterprises, popular, dissembling, but covering the
secrets of his minde with his outward behaviour, imbracing all times and
occasions, politike in stratagems, making much of his souldiars, and
honouring his captaines. But a Prince who hath blemished the greatest
beautie of his practises by extreame ambition; factious, a great
bragger, vaine in beleeving of soothsayers who assured him of his
greatnes, and of the change of his familie into a royaltie, proud, not
able to submit his hopes, even to those from whome hee should hope for
his advancement, giving men to understand by his inclination, that he
was not borne to obey, but to commaund, and with this dessein, he framed
the minds of the French, by his first actions, to beleeve that he had
partes fit to make a strange alteration in a realme."</p>

<p><b>1604-20.</b> <span class="smcap">Histori&aelig; sui temporis</span>, J. A. De Thou. The earliest editions,
published in 1604, do not mention Bussy. That of 1609, which carries on
the narrative to the year 1584, only mentions (lib. <span class="smcap">lii</span>, p. 132) his
proceedings during the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. It is the edition of
1620, published at Geneva, and embracing events till 1607 that includes
(lib. <span class="smcap">lxviii</span>, p. 330 ff.) the narrative of Bussy's murder, in printed
<a href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>, and (lib. <span class="smcap">cxiii</span>, p. 558) of Ren&eacute;e D'Ambois's meditated
revenge (cf. Introduction, <a href="#Page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</a>). The most convenient edition of De
Thou's History is that published by S. Buckley in 1733.</p>

<p><b>1615.</b> <span class="smcap">Les Histoires Tragiques de Nostre Temps</span>, Fran&ccedil;ois de Rosset. The
story of Bussy's love for the Countess of Montsoreau, and his murder
forms the subject of the 17th Histoire, <i>De la mort pitoyable du
valeureux Lysis</i>, the most important parts of which are printed in
Appendix A.</p>

published by F. Guessard for <i>La Societe de l'Histoire de France</i> (1842)
is the most convenient.</p>
